## Description
A rollicking, up-tempo honky-tonk rocker sung by a male Kentucky baritone, celebrating the beauty in imperfection. 'Krystal Snapped Her G String' is a tongue-in-cheek love song to a beat-up, beloved guitar, personified as a feisty, independent woman. The song features a swaggering two-step groove, bright, twangy electric guitar leads trading licks with fiddle fills and barroom piano. Acoustic guitar strums maintain a chunky rhythm alongside a walking bassline locked to a snappy snare/brush pattern. The chorus is punctuated by tambourine and rowdy gang vocals in a call-and-response style, leading to a dynamic half-time stop before the final, exuberant chorus. The guitars have a slight grit, the room mics are lively, and the fiddle playfully saws harmonies over the outro tag.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Purple as a bruised-up sunset, leanin’ on the barroom wall,
Sharpie hearts and phone numbers runnin’ down her scarred-up jaw.
I said, “Girl, you look expensive,” she said, “Honey, I was on sale.”
“Don’t judge me by my price tag—judge me by the songs I wail.”
Broadway neon kissed her, dust was settlin’ on the stage,
I strummed her soft and gentle like a book that’s lost a page.
She whispered like Kentucky wind, “Boy, treat me like a queen,”
Then I hit that old G string and she let out one sad scream.

Chorus
Krystal snapped her G string—poor girl, she’s sensitive,
Been patched with dental floss and prayers I barely can afford to give.
She don’t want a fancy doctor, says the squeaks are part of soul,
She’s purple, loud, and perfect, and she keeps me in control.
So pour one more, I’ll sing this thing,
Krystal snapped her G string.

Verse 2
Crowd laughed like a creek in spring, I laughed right along,
Signed up like a yearbook—every name a jukebox song.
Some big-shot suit said, “Son, that toy won’t cut a record.”
I said, “Watch this broken halo turn a bar into a church.”
Buddy tried to fix her up, brought tools and talk and pride,
Krystal winked her chipped-up paint—“Baby, let me live my life.”
I said, “She ain’t a problem, pal, she’s poetry with scars,”
Every rattle in that neck is just the lightning in my heart.

Chorus
Krystal snapped her G string—poor girl, she’s sensitive,
Been patched with dental floss and prayers I barely can afford to give.
She don’t want a fancy doctor, says the squeaks are part of soul,
She’s purple, loud, and perfect, and she keeps me in control.
If pretty means you never sting,
Krystal snapped her G string.

Bridge
They said, “Boy, upgrade your life, get chrome and shine and gloss.”
But I was raised to make do right, tie luck with minty floss.
She hums like gravel driveways, she buzzes like a bee,
And every time that G gives out, she laughs and sings with me.
‘Cause ain’t we all a little busted, tryin’ to make a joyful noise?
Krystal’s got a stubborn heart and mine’s a stubborn boy’s.

Breakdown / Call & Response
Crowd: “Why’s she purple and sad?”
Me: “She’s havin’ a day.”
Crowd: “Can we fix her?”
Me: “She don’t wanna be saved.”
Crowd: “Did you really play her down on Lower Broad last night?”
Me: “It was beautiful, y’all—she cried and held me tight.”

Guitar Solo
(Twangy electric guitar solo in A, emphasizing bends and double stops, building intensity before returning to the chorus)

Final Chorus
Krystal snapped her G string—poor girl, she’s sensitive,
I’ll kiss her fret by fret and let the wild notes live.
We don’t need a diamond ring, we don’t need solid gold,
Just crooked love and barroom lights to set our little world aglow.
So raise your glass, we’ll toast the queen—
Krystal snapped her G string.

Tag
If loving her is wrong, I’ll tune it ‘til it’s right—
Krystal broke, but she broke me good tonight.

Tempo: 126 BPM. The half-time feel before the final chorus should drop to around 63 BPM.

Dynamics: The song builds energy throughout, culminating in the final chorus. Utilize dynamics to create contrast and excitement. Pay attention to the breakdown section and ensure the call-and-response feels natural and engaging. 
Fiddle parts should incorporate double stops and bluegrass-inspired runs.

During the Tag, add a final, sustained A chord on the electric guitar with tremolo, letting it fade out.
