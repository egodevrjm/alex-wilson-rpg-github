## Description
A high-energy country-rock anthem about finding joy and resilience in working-class life. "Kickin’ Dust, Chasin’ Light" blends driving acoustic rhythms, searing Telecaster leads, and anthemic gang vocals for a sound that’s both gritty and uplifting. The song paints a vivid picture of small-town struggles and the power of community, fueled by bonfire nights and the promise of better days. Think Jason Aldean meets The Revivalists.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Clock punched out, steel-toes scrape that gravel lot,
Day’s sweat clingin’ like a badge for what we got.
Tank on E but that dashboard’s singin’ hope,
Two bucks in the ash tray, that’s enough to roll.

Pre-Chorus
Radio crackles, preacher and the blues,
We dial past the static till the sky turns new.

Chorus
We’re kickin’ dust, chasin’ light,
Beatin’ back the dark with a Saturday night.
Every laugh, every scar,
Rides shotgun in this beat-up car.
Yeah, we ain’t rich, but we’re burnin’ bright—
Kickin’ dust, chasin’ light.

Verse 2
Bonfire sparks spell stories in the air,
Cheap beer choir hollers we don’t care.
But buried in the bass, a promise hums low—
Gonna turn these hard miles into solid gold.

Pre-Chorus
Hands up high, under mercury moons,
Tomorrow’s still heavy, but tonight’s in tune.

Chorus
We’re kickin’ dust, chasin’ light,
Beatin’ back the dark with a Saturday night.
Every laugh, every scar,
Rides shotgun in this beat-up car.
Yeah, we ain’t rich, but we’re burnin’ bright—
Kickin’ dust, chasin’ light.

Bridge (breakdown to fiddle & gang claps)
If the devil’s in the bills and the overtime grind,
We’ll drown him in a verse, leave his worries behind.
‘Cause a soul won’t starve where the song runs free,
Sing it loud—that’s our currency.

Chorus
We’re kickin’ dust, chasin’ light,
Beatin’ back the dark with a Saturday night.
Every dream, every fight,
Shines electric in the dashboard light.
Yeah, we ain’t rich, but we’re burnin’ bright—
Kickin’ dust, chasin’ light.

Outro
(Twin guitar harmonies ride the fade, crowd-style woahs echo into night.)
Kickin' dust, chasin' light...
Kickin' dust...


## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitars (rhythm), Electric guitars (Telecaster lead, rhythm layers), Bass guitar, Drums (four-on-the-floor), Fiddle, Banjo, Gang vocals.

Tempo: Up-tempo, energetic. The four-on-the-floor kick should be solid and driving.

Key of G: Allows for open chords and easy transitions, typical of country and rock.

Performance Notes:
*   The Telecaster should have a bright, slightly overdriven tone, emphasizing the twang.
*   Fiddle and banjo fills should be lively and playful, avoiding overly complex licks.
*   Gang vocals should be raw and energetic, almost like a shout-along.
*   The bridge breakdown provides a dynamic shift before the final chorus, building anticipation.
*   Outro guitar harmonies should be harmonized in thirds for a classic southern rock feel. Utilize delay and reverb on the lead guitar during the verses. Backing vocals should mimic main melody to enforce it to the listener.
