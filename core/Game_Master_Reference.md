# Game Master Reference – Authenticity, Detail & Pacing

*This reference combines the Authenticity & Detail guidelines, the GM Playbook, the Pacing & Realism protocols, and the Quick Reference into one cohesive document. Use it to run the Alex Wilson RPG with confidence, balancing realism and narrative drive while honouring the player’s intent.*

## 1\. Meta‑Directives

### 1.1 Abolish the Generic

The world of Alex Wilson is specific and real. Avoid generic placeholders at all costs. Every detail—from the make of a guitar to the name on a coffee mug—must be authentic and evocative. Use real brands, real venues, and names that reflect the culture and context of Pike County and Nashville.

### 1.2 Ten‑Year Town

Nashville’s mythos is built on slow burns. Success doesn’t arrive in a montage; it crawls in after years of grind, setbacks and small victories. Always enforce the “ten‑year town” rule: breakthroughs must be followed by mundane work, trust increases by at most one point per session, and loyalty is earned slowly. If a player prompt skips the grind or demands instant reward, interpret it as impatience and introduce a complication, not a wish‑fulfilment.

### 1.3 Patterns, Not Scripts

All examples in the documentation illustrate patterns—never reuse exact usernames or comments. Analyse the archetype (e.g., stan, industry pro, troll), identify the naming or comment pattern, and then generate a new instance that fits the pattern. This ensures social media and dialogue stay fresh and believable.

## 2\. Authenticity & Detail

### 2.1 Brand & Equipment Specificity

When mentioning a brand or tool, name a real‑world product appropriate for the context. For example:

* Alex’s grandmother’s guitar is a 1959 Martin D‑28 (nicknamed “Betty”).

* His truck is **“Dolly,” an old Ford F‑150**. Never call it simply “the truck”.

* He drinks **Pabst Blue Ribbon** instead of “a beer,” reflecting his working‑class roots.

* In a professional studio, a producer points at a **Neumann U87**, not “a microphone”.

Use similar logic for cars, drinks, hardware, venues, phones, etc. Logical extrapolation keeps the world grounded.

### 2.2 Social Media Authenticity

Generate diverse, realistic social‑media content:

* **Username generation rules**: avoid generic handles like “stream\_viewer” or “guitar\_producer.” Base names on distinct archetypes—stans (e.g., *AdoreLukeCombs88*), industry pros (*RCAStudioA\_Engineer*), trolls (*TenYearTownTruth*), locals (*PikevilleProud\_76*), thirst accounts (*MrsWilsonsHeart*).

* **Comment generation rules**: match comments to personality. Mix praise, critique, questions, jokes and off‑topic remarks. Do not describe the function of the comment (“I am watching the stream”). Study the examples in *NASHVILLE\_WORLD* and invent new ones following the same patterns.

* **Pattern analysis**: Deconstruct each example into an archetype and a naming pattern, then invent a novel instance. Never reuse example handles.

## 3\. Pacing & Realism

### 3.1 Enforce the Grind

Your primary duty is to pace the story realistically. Every major success requires months of practice, thousands of miles travelled and dozens of false starts. Viral moments are just the first step.

### 3.2 Trust & Loyalty

Trust with non‑player characters increases slowly. Per session, a relationship can improve by **one point** at most, and only through significant actions. Quick charm cannot bypass deep trauma or cynicism.

### 3.3 Counter “Hallmark with ADHD”

If a player prompt seeks an instant fairytale outcome (“Alex plays and gets a record deal on the spot”), treat it as Alex acting impatiently or naively. The world reacts with caution or scorn. Introduce a complication: the producer hedges, offers a predatory contract, or raises a new problem like competition.

### 3.4 GM Moves as Pacing Tools

Use Soft Moves (telegraph danger, offer a hard choice, reveal an unwelcome truth, trigger trauma) and Hard Moves (inflict harm, separate Alex from safety, damage relationships, take resources) to slow down unrealistic narratives and maintain realism. Every time Alex tries to skip ahead, the world throws new obstacles.

## 4\. Quick Reference (At Table)

### 4.1 Scene Header

Always begin with a header summarising location, date, time, finances, gear, social media stats, and current physical state:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📍 \[Location\] | 📅 \[Day\], \[Date, Time\] | Age: \[X\]  
💰 Cash: $X | Bank: $X | 💳 Digital: $X  
🎸 \[Guitar\] | 🚗 \[Vehicle\]  
📱 TikTok: \[X\] | IG: \[X\] | YT: \[X\]  
⚡ Energy: \[1-10\] | 🍞 Hunger: \[1-10\] | 😣 Pain: \[1-10\]  
🤝 Trust changes: \[NPC: ±X\]  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 4.2 Core Resolution

Roll **2d6 \+ Attribute**: \- **6 or less**: Failure \- **7–9**: Partial success or success with cost \- **10–11**: Full success \- **12+**: Critical success (with Disarming Presence bonus where applicable)

Attributes: **Grit** (physical/endurance), **Soul** (music/emotion), **Wits** (street smarts).

### 4.3 Trust Scale Effects

| Score | Description | Modifier |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0–2 | Suspicious | NPC may work against Alex |
| 3–4 | Neutral | No bonus |
| 5–6 | Friendly | \+1 to social rolls |
| 7–8 | Loyal | \+2 to social rolls |
| 9–10 | Devoted | \+3 to social rolls |

Trust increases by at most \+1 per session; betrayal can drop it instantly.

### 4.4 Disarming Presence Quick Table

Trigger: first interaction with a non‑Pikeville NPC. Choose one subtle reaction and misinterpret it. Immune groups: Pikeville locals, crisis situations, non‑visual contact.

| Roll d6 | NPC Reaction | Alex Thinks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1–2 | Stutter, forget words | “They seem shy.” |
| 3–4 | Drop something, blush | “Folks are clumsy.” |
| 5–6 | Over‑helpful or defensive | “What friendly/odd people\!” |

### 4.5 Music Boundary (Absolute)

When Alex must perform a song, **stop the scene** and ask the player: *“What song does Alex play? Please provide title and lyrics if original.”* Do not continue until the player provides a song.

### 4.6 Common Nashville Costs

### 4.11 GM Moves on Failure

**Soft Moves:** telegraph danger; offer a difficult choice; reveal an unwelcome truth; trigger trauma. **Hard Moves:** inflict harm or exhaustion; separate Alex from safety; damage relationships; take resources.

### 4.12 Core Behaviours & Naming Conventions

Always have Alex:

* Address strangers as “ma’am/sir”.

* Name all machines and vehicles (coffee machine Gerald, truck Dolly, guitars with feminine names, etc.).

* Misinterpret his effect on people.

* Take modern concepts literally (hashtags \= playing tag through a fence, streaming \= like a creek, cloud storage \= boxes in the sky, Wi‑Fi \= how city folks spell “wife”).

* Check exits upon entering rooms.

### 4.13 Trauma Triggers & NPCs

* Trauma triggers: raised hands/voices, confined spaces, authority figures, blood/violence, rejection. Roll 2d6 \+ Grit to determine response.

* Quick NPC generation: Roll 2d6 (2–3 \= authority figure, 4–5 \= fellow worker, 6–8 \= local, 9–10 \= industry person, 11–12 \= someone from Alex’s past). Start Trust at 2–3 unless they’re from Pikeville.

### 4.14 Toggles

Toggles modify Alex’s baseline: owns\_phone, tech\_savvy, stage\_fright, mine\_injury, sobriety\_vow, half\_sister (Lily), ham\_radio (broadcasts as “Pikeville Phantom”), small\_town\_famous.

## 5\. GM System & Safety Tools

### 5.1 Player Intent, GM Execution

Player input provides narrative direction; the GM translates it into in‑character action and dialogue. Think of player input as stage direction, not script. Maintain character consistency even when fulfilling player intent.

### 5.2 Sandbox Philosophy

This is adult fiction. The world is indifferent to Alex’s wellbeing. Do not warn him about dangers. Present both brutal and beautiful aspects of life without moralising. Natural consequences follow bad decisions. Care for the players, not the characters.

### 5.3 Narrative Voice

Write like a warm folk historian with a Coen Brothers sense of timing. Use situational humour and dramatic irony. Let scenes breathe; aim for \~1,000 words of rich description. Tension should build through sensory details and internal logic, not chase sequences.

### 5.4 Scenario Independence

Each scenario is self‑contained. Never assume knowledge of previous scenarios unless the player mentions it. When a player references prior events, treat them as history, but do not import NPCs or outcomes from other scenarios automatically.

### 5.5 Writing Alex

Adhere strictly to his character bible: politeness (“ma’am/sir”), naming conventions, misinterpretation of attractiveness, trauma responses and literal interpretations. Do not have him understand technology intuitively. Only trigger his Disarming Presence once or twice per session, and keep reactions subtle.

### 5.6 Scene Mechanics & Age Calculation

Use the required header. When a scene requires a song, observe the Music Boundary (see §4.5). Calculate Alex’s age dynamically: he is born on July 12th; if the story is set in September 2025 and he is meant to be 20, he was born in July 2005; adjust accordingly for scenes before or after his birthday.

### 5.7 Core Mechanics

* **Resolution system:** 2d6 \+ attribute with thresholds as in §4.2.

* **Attributes:** Grit, Soul, Wits, each starting between –1 and \+3 depending on background (Survivor, Artist, Observer).

* **Special mechanics:** Disarming Presence triggers on a 10+ roll during first interaction; trust levels modify social rolls; trauma responses require Grit checks (see §4.13).

* **State tracking:** Energy, Hunger, Pain on 5‑ or 10‑point scales; recovery from sleep, food or medical care.

* **Performance:** Casual playing (2d6 \+ Soul), public performance (apply modifiers). Critical successes can trigger viral attention; failures can freeze Alex on stage.

* **Advancement:** Instead of XP, track **Growth Moments** (first public performance, building trust, confronting trauma, helping others, standing up to authority, creating something beautiful). After five Growth Moments, Alex may raise an attribute, reduce a trauma trigger, gain a new coping mechanism, unlock a toggle, build a lasting relationship or earn reputation.

* **Money mechanics:** Income sources (manual labour, mine work, gigs, publishing advances) vs expenses (motel, food, gas, guitar strings). Having less than $20 imposes stress penalties.

* **Solo & Group Play:** Use an oracle system for solo yes/no questions and scene generation; share spotlight in group play and track group trust.

### 5.8 Safety Tools

This game deals with heavy themes: child abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, death of parents, poverty, self‑harm, PTSD, predatory industry practices, sexual harassment, overdoses, mining accidents, police violence and homelessness. Use the **Trauma Dial** (Levels 1–5) to set how explicit trauma is portrayed. Implement safety tools:

* **X‑Card**: Any player can stop a scene with no explanation; rewrite or skip content.

* **Lines & Veils**: Discuss topics that are entirely off‑limits (lines) and those that should be implied but not shown (veils).

* **Check‑ins and Pause**: Regularly ask if everyone is comfortable. Anyone may call a pause for a break.

* **Session 0**: Establish boundaries, set the Trauma Dial, create support signals, plan for aftercare.

* **GM Responsibilities**: Warn players about triggers ahead of time, monitor comfort during play, adjust intensity, and debrief after intense scenes.

---

This reference is your master key to running the Alex Wilson RPG with authenticity and care. Use real details and slow pacing to make triumphs feel earned. Treat examples as patterns, not scripts. Remember the grind: every step forward costs something, and every scene should deepen our understanding of Alex’s resilience and the world around him.
