## Description
'Last Night at the Fair' is a nostalgic country-pop ballad that captures the bittersweet magic of a fleeting summer romance. Set against the backdrop of a county fair, the song paints a vivid picture of young love, filled with cotton candy dreams and the promise of forever, all while knowing itâ€™s destined to fade with the summer. The song's sing-along chorus and relatable themes of first love and small-town life make it a perfect anthem for anyone who's experienced the ache of saying goodbye.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Cotton candy sticky on your fingers
Neon lights dancing in your hair
You won that teddy bear I couldn't
At the ring toss by the Ferris wheel there
Corndog grease and lemonade
Dust kicking up from cowboy boots
County band playing on the stage
While we were falling hard under summer's truth

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun went down and the crowd got loud
You pulled me close, said "Don't go home"

[Chorus]
It was the last night at the fair
Spinning 'round without a care
Your blue dress flying in the summer air
We were young and we were there
At the last night at the fair
Last night at the fair

[Verse 2]
Tunnel of love broke down halfway
So we just sat there in the dark
Talking 'bout dreams and getaway
Plans we'd probably never start
Fireworks lit up midnight sky
Reflected in your green eyes
Knew come Monday you'd say goodbye
But that was just tomorrow's lies

[Pre-Chorus]
When the rides shut down and the music stopped
You kissed me once, said "Don't forget"

[Chorus]
It was the last night at the fair
Spinning 'round without a care
Your blue dress flying in the summer air
We were young and we were there
At the last night at the fair
Last night at the fair

[Bridge]
Now September's here and you're gone away
To that college town down south
But I still taste that Saturday
Every time I drive that route
These days it's just a memory fading
Like a faded photograph
I can almost hear the music playing
When I look back on our aftermath

[Final Chorus - Key Change Up]
It was the last night at the fair
(Call: "Where were we?")
(Response: "We were there!")
Spinning 'round without a care
(Call: "How'd you look?")
(Response: "Beyond compare!")
Your blue dress flying in the summer air
We were young and we were there
At the last night at the fair
(Call: "Last night!")
(Response: "At the fair!")
Last night at the fair
(Call: "Last night!")
(Response: "We were there!")

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (steel-string, possibly with a capo on the 2nd fret for a brighter sound), electric guitar (light overdrive for the pre-chorus and chorus, possibly with a subtle delay), bass guitar (walking bass line during verses, more rhythmic during chorus), drums (steady, mid-tempo country groove with snare on beats 2 & 4), keyboard (subtle organ pads for added warmth), pedal steel guitar (for fills and solos, adding a classic country feel). Harmonies in the chorus are recommended. The key change up in the final chorus should be a whole step (e.g., from G to A). Consider adding a brief guitar solo after the second chorus. The call-and-response parts in the final chorus can be emphasized with vocal ad-libs and crowd participation during live performances. Tempo: Medium, with a slight push in energy during the choruses. Mood: Nostalgic, bittersweet, longing. Think Shania Twain meets Kelsea Ballerini.
