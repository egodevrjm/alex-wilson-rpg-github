Alex Wilson's poignant lyrics paint a vivid picture of a man clinging to optimism, symbolized by a perpetually muddy creek and an unreturned phone call.

## Lyrics

Verse 1:
I keep coming back to this old creek bend
Where the water runs brown after every rain
Telling myself this time it'll run clear
But I'm staring at mud once again
That afternoon sun makes it look like gold
But I know better, still I can't let go

Chorus:
I'm a muddy water optimist
Keeping faith in what don't exist
Every storm just stirs up the dirt
But I keep believing it won't always hurt
Maybe I'm a fool, maybe I'm blessed
I'm a muddy water optimist

Verse 2:
She said she'd call me when she got to town
That was three weeks and a bottle ago
But I still check my phone every hour
Like a man who just can't let hope go
My buddies say I'm wasting my time
But what if this time she don't change her mind

Chorus:
I'm a muddy water optimist
Keeping faith in what don't exist
Every storm just stirs up the dirt
But I keep believing it won't always hurt
Maybe I'm a fool, maybe I'm blessed
I'm a muddy water optimist

Bridge:
Daddy used to fish this same old spot
Said the water's been muddy since he was small
But he kept casting that old cane pole
Guess I got his stubborn after all
And momma always said I was too kind
Blind to the world and the cruel things it hides

Chorus:
I'm a muddy water optimist
Keeping faith in what don't exist
Every storm just stirs up the dirt
But I keep believing it won't always hurt
Maybe I'm a fool, maybe I'm blessed
I'm a muddy water optimist

Outro:
Yeah, I'm a muddy water optimist
Still believing in what don't exist
Muddy water optimist, yeah
Still holding on, still holding on...

## Performance Notes

"Muddy Water Optimist" should be performed with a sense of weary hope. The tempo is moderate, allowing the lyrics to take center stage. Instrumentation should include acoustic guitar (fingerpicked or strummed), upright bass, subtle drums (brushes are preferable), and possibly a pedal steel guitar or fiddle for added texture. Alex's vocal delivery should be raw and honest, conveying both the disappointment and the unwavering belief. The bridge provides an opportunity for a slight dynamic shift, perhaps with a touch more intensity in the vocals and instrumentation, before returning to the quieter, more reflective mood of the chorus. Pay attention to the spaces between phrases; let the music breathe. The outro should gradually fade, leaving the listener with a lingering sense of hopeful resignation. Consider a harmonica solo during the instrumental break between the second verse and second chorus, emphasizing the bluesy undertones.
