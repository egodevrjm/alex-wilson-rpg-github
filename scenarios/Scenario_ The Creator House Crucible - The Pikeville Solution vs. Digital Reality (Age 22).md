## **Scenario: The Creator House Crucible \- The Pikeville Solution vs. Digital Reality (Age 22\)**

**Setup:** It's late summer, 2027\. The Cochran Mine laid off half its workforce, including Alex and his best friend, Tommy Crawford. Armed with $20,000 cash from the sale of his late MawMaw Judith's trailer (a fortune to them) and a shared sense of "now or never," they packed up Tommy's truck, "Dolly," and pointed it toward Nashville.

The brutal reality of Nashville's rental market forced them into a single, shared room in the attic of "24East," a chaotic, always-on content collective in East Nashvilleâ€”the cheapest rent they could find.

**Canon Context:** Alex was raised by his MawMaw Judith, a kind but strict woman who never sang or played music. She bought him his first real guitar, a **1959 Martin D-28**, when he was seven. She died when he was 19, leaving him the trailer.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The House Dynamics (What they're walking into):**

* **The Mission:** The house operates on a simple premise: everything is content. Life is a 24/7 livestream.  
* **The Rules:**  
  1. **Always Live:** All common areas are public sets, fair game for streaming at any time.  
  2. **The House Cut:** The collective takes a 10% cut of all creative earnings generated by its members while they live there.  
* **Narrative Tone:** **CRITICAL:** Alex is **not** intimidated or overwhelmed by the content culture. He finds the entire scenario ridiculous and treats the house and its rules like a strange, elaborate joke or an absurd dare. His default response is curiosity, casual amusement, and "Hold My Beer" confidence. Tommy finds it hilarious.

### **Opening Scene: The Welcome Committee**

**Date:** Tuesday, September 9th, 2027, 3:15 PM **Location:** The front porch of 24East, a purple Victorian on Gallatin Pike, East Nashville.

Alex and Tommy have just hauled their entire lives (two duffel bags, the 1959 Martin, and the Ford Ranger) onto the porch.

The front door swings open. A young woman, **Luna** (blue hair, crypto t-shirt), stands there, holding her phone up, the red light of a livestream blinking.

"Hey besties, welcome to the content vortex\!" she says in a practiced, upbeat chirp aimed at her phone's camera. "It's your girl Luna, here with the new roomies\! Say hey to the stream, guys\!"

Tommy stares. Alex, in his t-shirt and work-carved muscle, gives a small, polite nod.

Luna's eyes move from her screen and lock with Alex's. Her professional influencer mask glitches, the spiel stops, and the phone almost drops.

"Oh," she says, her voice suddenly real. "You're... Alex."
