## Lyrics

[Intro]
(Bright acoustic guitar riff, hand claps, "hey hey" vocals)
Ba da da da, ba da da da
[Verse 1]
Tommy's doing ninety down Route 65
Anniversary dinner was supposed to be at five
Stops at the Chevron, grabs the best of what's left
Twelve bucks for forgiveness wrapped in cellophane and breath
Sarah's meeting Tyler from that dating app
Running late 'cause she couldn't find the right ball cap
Grabs a bunch of yellow ones to match her sundress
Sometimes Cupid works the register at the Texaco Express
[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't from no fancy flower shop
Next to the beef jerky and the soda pop
But when you need a miracle at ten p.m.
Thank God for...
[Chorus]
Gas station roses, five kinds of sorry in a bunch
Gas station roses, for when you mess up or miss lunch
They're sitting by the lottery tickets
Right there with the last-minute fixes
Wrapped up in plastic, love in distress
Gas station roses - hey, desperate times, desperate measures
(Ba da da da, ba da da da)
Gas station roses, saving asses since forever
[Verse 2]
Jenny's at the Shell 'cause her husband had to work
Their daughter's first recital and she's feeling like a jerk
Buys three bunches just to fill the empty seat
Sometimes love looks like wilted stems and a receipt
Marcus hits the BP after one too many beers
Said some things he shouldn't, now he's shifting through the gears
Parks outside her apartment with those roses and a prayer
'Cause nothing says "I'm sorry" like flowers from nowhere
[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't gonna win no beauty prize
Half dead already, full of white lies
But when you need a Hail Mary at half past ten
Thank God for...
[Chorus]
Gas station roses, five kinds of sorry in a bunch
Gas station roses, for when you mess up or miss lunch
They're sitting by the lottery tickets
Right there with the last-minute fixes
Wrapped up in plastic, love in distress
Gas station roses - hey, desperate times, desperate measures
(Ba da da da, ba da da da)
Gas station roses, saving asses since forever
[Bridge]
From the Conoco to the Circle K
They're moving roses every single day
'Cause somewhere somebody's running late
Somebody's wrong, somebody's wait--ing...
By the coffee and the energy drinks
Between the motor oil and the kitchen sinks
There's a rainbow of apologies
Ninety-nine cent guarantees
That you're trying!
[Guitar Solo]
(Electric guitar solo with a country twang, building in intensity)
[Final Chorus]
Gas station roses, five kinds of sorry in a bunch
Gas station roses, breakfast tacos of the romance punch
They're sitting by the scratch-off dreams
Right there with the "forgive me" schemes
Wrapped up in plastic, love in distress
Gas station roses - hey, desperate times, desperate measures
[Outro-Chorus]
Gas station roses (hey!)
Everybody knows it (hey!)
When you're in the doghouse
That's the way it goes, it's
Gas station roses (ba da da da)
Saving our asses (ba da da da)
Gas station roses
Since forever and ever, amen!
(Hey, hey, hey!)
[Outro]
Next time you're in trouble, here's what you do
Hit up the Exxon on Avenue Two
And if they're out of roses, don't you fret or frown
Just grab a Slim Jim, turn your car around!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (rhythm), Electric Guitar (lead, fills), Pedal Steel Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drums (kick, snare, hi-hat), Dobro (bridge solo), Synth Pads (subtle layering), Handclaps, Backing Vocals (stacked harmonies). The 'ba da da da' sections should be light and airy, sung with a touch of whimsy. The handclaps should be tight and well-rehearsed, providing a percussive drive. The electric guitar should have a slightly overdriven tone, appropriate for country rock. The bass should be punchy and supportive, locking in with the kick drum to create a solid groove. Consider adding a subtle mandolin part during the verses to enhance the Americana feel. Tempo: Moderate shuffle. Mood: Upbeat, humorous, and heartwarming. The song should evoke a sense of relatability and nostalgia.
