## Description
A haunting Appalachian folk-rock song in E minor, 'Holler Echo' explores themes of identity, resilience, and finding solace in nature. At 88 BPM, the track opens with finger-picked guitar emphasizing resonant low-string drones, creating a sense of vastness and solitude. A deep, stomping floor tom sets an insistent, earthy rhythm, reminiscent of a boot on a plywood porch. A melancholic whistle line weaves throughout, evoking the wind whistling across mountain ridges. Sparse and percussive verses build into choruses that yearn for connection and self-discovery. Instrumental breaks feature fiddle and harmonica, adding layers of raw, emotional texture. The bridge offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that even weathered hearts can find resonance. The outro strips back to guitar and whistle, leaving the listener with a lingering sense of both loneliness and quiet strength.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Creek runs thin where the shale gives way,
Night comes quick in the mouth of the cave.
I hurled my secrets at the slate-gray sky,
Echo came back: “Boy, learn to survive.”

[Chorus]
Holler echo, answer me true—
Tell me who I am when the dark pulls through.
If the ridge can bear my tangled refrain,
Maybe I ain’t singing in vain.
Holler echo… carry me home again.

[Verse 2]
Daddy’s words were coal-dust grit,
Mama’s lullaby?—never learned it.
So I let the timber cry in a minor drone,
Waited for the mountain to carve me a tone.

[Chorus]
Holler echo, answer me true—
Tell me who I am when the dark pulls through.
If the ridge can bear my tangled refrain,
Maybe I ain’t singing in vain.
Holler echo… carry me home again.

[Bridge]
I ain’t afraid of the quiet no more,
Let the valley fill with the tremble of hope.
What bounces back is a weathered chord—
Proof that even rough hearts echo.

[Verse 3]
Grandpa's fiddle, dusty and worn,
Hangs on the wall, a life overgrown.
His stories linger in the wood and strings,
A silent chorus the mountain brings.

[Final Chorus]
Holler echo, answer me true—
Tell me who I am when the dawn breaks through.
If the ridge can hold my fractured refrain,
Maybe I’m more than the ache in my name.
Holler echo… carry me home again.
Holler echo… carry me home.
Holler echo…

## Performance Notes

Key: E minor. Time Signature: 4/4. Tempo: 88 BPM. Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (finger-picked, focusing on drone notes on the E and B strings), floor tom (played with a soft mallet or a boot stomp), whistle (high and lonesome melody), optional fiddle and harmonica (for instrumental breaks, playing simple, mournful lines). The guitar should be tuned down a half-step for a heavier, more resonant feel (Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb). Vocals: Male, tenor range, with a slightly raspy and emotional delivery. Performance: Emphasize the raw, earthy sound of the instruments. The floor tom provides a simple, driving rhythm. Vocals should be delivered with vulnerability and honesty. The whistle and fiddle lines should evoke the feeling of wind and wide-open spaces. Dynamic contrast is key: build from sparse verses to more full choruses. Use a slight reverb on the guitar and vocals to create a sense of space and echo.
