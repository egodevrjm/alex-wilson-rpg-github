## Lyrics

(Intro - Upbeat acoustic guitar riff with banjo plucks and handclaps, setting a fun, foot-tappin' pop-country vibe, like a joyride gone wrong but still hilarious)

(Verse 1)
Friday night, got my paycheck in hand,
Truck's actin' up, but I got big plans.
She's textin' me sweet, sayin' "Pick me up at eight,"
But the dash is glowin' orange, sealin' my fate.
Mechanic's callin', says it's gonna cost a ton,
Do I fix the ol' girl or have some fun?

(Pre-Chorus)
Heart's revvin' high, but the engine's low,
Gotta make a choice, which way to go?

(Chorus - Super catchy hook, full band explosion with singalong energy and "oh oh" chants)
Check engine light love, blinkin' in the dash,
Truck or my baby, gotta spend that cash!
Oh oh, fix the ride or take her dancin'?
Check engine light love, what a tough romancin'!
Yeah, she's shinin' bright, but so's that warnin' sign,
Check engine light love, which one's gonna be mine?
Oh oh, truck trouble or date night delight?
Check engine light love, keepin' me up all night!

(Verse 2)
She's in that sundress, lookin' fine as can be,
Truck's sputterin' bad, beggin' "Please fix me!"
Oil change or roses? Wrench or a kiss?
One's reliable, the other's pure bliss.
Friends say "Man up, get under the hood,"
But her smile's sayin' "Boy, you know you should."

(Pre-Chorus)
Wallet's feelin' thin, decisions on the line,
Gotta pick my poison, make up my mind.

(Chorus - Bigger build, infectious fun with crowd "oh oh"s)
Check engine light love, blinkin' in the dash,
Truck or my baby, gotta spend that cash!
Oh oh, fix the ride or take her dancin'?
Check engine light love, what a tough romancin'!
Yeah, she's shinin' bright, but so's that warnin' sign,
Check engine light love, which one's gonna be mine?
Oh oh, truck trouble or date night delight?
Check engine light love, keepin' me up all night!

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic strums and claps, then surges)
Maybe I'll do both, tighten a bolt or two,
Then cruise to her door, make the night come true.
'Cause love's like a truck, needs a little care,
Fix 'em both up, take 'em anywhere!

(Chorus - Massive party finale with whoops and cheers)
Check engine light love, blinkin' in the dash,
Truck or my baby, gotta spend that cash!
Oh oh, fix the ride or take her dancin'?
Check engine light love, what a tough romancin'!
Yeah, she's shinin' bright, but so's that warnin' sign,
Check engine light love, which one's gonna be mine?
Oh oh, truck trouble or date night delight?
Check engine light love, keepin' me up all night!

(Outro - Fades with banjo riff, echoing "oh oh"s, and truck engine rev sounds)
Check engine light love... oh oh, what a night!
Truck and my girl, gonna make it right!


## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar, banjo, drums (tight and punchy), bass, fiddle, handclaps, layered harmonies in pre-chorus and chorus. Tempo: Upbeat and driving. Key: G Major. Vocal Style: Male lead with a playful, slightly exaggerated country drawl. Backing vocals should be tight harmonies, especially in the pre-chorus build-up. The banjo should be prominent but not overwhelming, providing rhythmic drive and fills. Fiddle flourishes add to the country feel. The bridge section offers an opportunity for a brief instrumental breakdown featuring a call-and-response between the banjo and fiddle. The outro should build slightly, ending with a final engine rev and a fading echo of the 'oh oh's'. Consider adding a 'holler' or two for extra energy in the live performance. Dynamics: Verses should be slightly softer than choruses. Ensure a strong build into each chorus for maximum impact.
