**October 19, 1971**

3 A.M. This whole town smells like stale perfume and broken promises tonight. Or maybe that’s just the smell of George’s bourbon on the pillow next to me. He’s gone, of course. He sings like an angel who’s been kicked out of heaven one too many times, and he leaves a room the same way. A beautiful, sorrowful storm that’s just passing through. We didn’t talk much. We just… recognized each other. Two ghosts haunting the same machine.

The letter from RCA is on the nightstand. My lawyer sent it over yesterday. Ten years. My contract is officially fulfilled. A full decade of my life, signed away on page four of a document I was too young and too hungry to read properly. They handed me $30,000 a year and I thought I was the richest girl in Pikeville. A fortune. Now I know what it really was: the price of a soul, bought on the cheap. My voice has made them millions. My heartbreaks have paid for their houses in Belle Meade. And now they want to do it all over again.

This time it’s different. They’re not dealing with a seventeen-year-old runaway anymore. They’re talking about a “king’s ransom.” Creative control. My name above the title on the album cover. A new Cadillac. They’re finally offering me the world, right at the moment I’m starting to think it’s the last thing on earth I want.

They think the fight has been about money and respect. And maybe it was, for a while. But it’s not anymore. Last night, before George showed up, I was sitting here with this guitar—the sunburst he gave me years ago, the one that feels more like a part of my body than my own hands do—and I wasn’t trying to write a hit. I was trying to remember a song my grandma used to hum while she was snapping beans on the porch. I couldn’t find it. I could write a hundred songs about cheating and drinking, but I’ve forgotten the ones about the rain. Nashville has traded my memories for royalties.

Now the cage door is open. My ten years are up. And everyone in this town, from Chet Atkins down to the shoeshine boy on Broadway, thinks my only question is “How much?” They think I’m sitting here, planning a negotiation.

They don’t know I’m sitting here trying to remember the way home.

They want to crown Rosie Walker, but all I want is to go find Rose Marie Hatfield and ask her if she’s okay. I’m not sure she is. I’m not sure she’s even been in this town at all.

### 

### 1\. The Fortunate Sons

**Description:** *A stark, Appalachian-style folk ballad at 80 BPM. The recording is intentionally raw, featuring only Rosie's unadorned vocal and her own clawhammer banjo picking. The sparse arrangement is punctuated by a mournful harmonica, played by a session musician she paid in cash, which echoes the lonesome sound of a train whistle cutting through the Kentucky hills. This is not a polished Nashville track; it's a protest song, a eulogy, and a declaration of allegiance to the people she left behind.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Billy Ray Caulfield. That’s the name that started this song. He was two years behind me in school, quarterbacked the Pikeville Panthers, and had a smile that could charm a snake out of its skin. He didn’t want to go. Nobody did. But his daddy was a miner and his granddaddy was a miner, and boys like Billy Ray don’t get deferments. They get dog tags. I was at the Opry, all decked out in Nudie’s rhinestones, singing about some made-up heartbreak, when I heard he’d been killed outside of Da Nang. I went back to the hotel, took off the glitter, and this song bled out of me. This town wants me to sing about cheatin’ hearts. But there’s a bigger, colder kind of cheating going on, and it’s breaking the only hearts that ever mattered to me.”*

**(Song: The Fortunate Sons)**

**(Clawhammer banjo intro in A-minor, stark and rhythmic)**

**(Verse 1\)** The senator's boy is learnin' French in a fancy college town The banker's boy is drivin' fast with the ragtop folded down They got a doctor's note, a friendly judge, a deferment bought and paid While the telegrams fly thick as crows down the roads the coal mines made And they flutter to the porches where the porch lights stay on late A folded flag for a mother's son is a cruel and twisted fate.

**(Verse 2\)** Billy Ray from Harlan County never saw his nineteenth year Swapped his football helmet for a jungle filled with fear Told me once he'd be a doctor, or maybe he'd just teach A future just a mile wide, but always out of reach His mama's got his varsity coat in a cedar box upstairs Next to a stack of letters filled with unanswered prayers.

**(Chorus)** This ain't our fight, it's their damn war, but our blood is on the ground They're sendin' mountain boys to die without a whisper of a sound Oh, some folks are born the fortunate sons, with a silver spoon to hold But ours are born to dig their daddy's coal and die when they are told.

**(Harmonica Solo \- sorrowful and echoing, like a distant train)**

**(Bridge)** I sing my songs at the Opry, all rhinestones, smoke, and light And the men in suits all tell me, "Sing of love, and keep it bright." But I see the faces in the crowd, the ones who've lost their own And I know this polished counterfeit ain't what the seeds of country's sown This ain't no song of heartbreak, it's a song about a crime And I'm tired of sellin' lies while we run right out of time.

**(Final Chorus)** This ain't our fight, it's their damn war, but our blood is on the ground They're sendin' our best boys to die without a whisper of a sound Oh, some folks are born the fortunate sons, who'll never feel the cold But ours are born to fight for them... and die when they are told.

**(Banjo fades out on a single, resonant note)**

### 2\. Atkins Can Kiss My Ass

**Description:** *A raw, overdriven, blues-infused barroom stomp at 130 BPM. This sounds like it was recorded after midnight with a bottle of bourbon on the mixing console. Rosie's vocals are pushed into the red, cracking with glorious, defiant distortion. The track is driven by a pounding, slightly out-of-tune upright piano, a snarling Telecaster guitar playing greasy licks, and a loose, heavy-handed drum beat. It's the sound of a woman kicking her stall door down.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Had the big meeting with Mr. Guitar himself today. He sat behind that giant desk, didn’t look up for a full minute. Then he takes off his glasses and says, ‘Rosie, the numbers on the last record were… gentle. We need you to be more… palatable.’ He slid a stack of songs across the desk. Terrible, syrupy things about daisies and holding hands. He said I needed to stop wearing the black jeans, cut the ‘sullen’ act, and be the nice girl he knows I can be. I just looked at him. At his perfect suit and his perfect hair. And I thought about every compromise, every time I bit my tongue, every time I smiled when I wanted to scream. I stood up, pushed his awful songs back into his lap, and said, ‘Chet, you can take your palatability and shove it.’ I didn't write this song. I just reported the facts."*

---

**(Song: Atkins Can Kiss My Ass)**

**(Intro \- A sloppy, loud drum fill kicks into a driving piano and a snarling guitar riff in E)**

**(Verse 1\)** Well, the man in the suit with the polished shoes and the fifty-dollar grin Leaned back in his leather chair and said, "Now, where do I begin? Your sound is too aggressive, dear, your lyrics are too blue You've gotta learn to play the game like all the good girls do." He said, "Smile more for the cameras, and for God's sake, wear a dress\!" I poured his water on his desk and left him with the mess.

**(Chorus)** 'Cause I ain't no porcelain doll on a Nashville music shelf And if you want a puppet, you can play it by yourself You can keep your contracts and your condescending class You can tell Chet Atkins he can kiss my Appalachian ass\!

**(Verse 2\)** He wants a girl who'll curtsy low and never make a scene Who sings about the sweet tea life and keeps her language clean Who'll bat her eyes for the camera and thank him for the chance Well, he can go and find himself a different girl to dance I didn't crawl out of the hollers, I didn't learn to fret To be the sweet, tame little pet of the Nashville social set.

**(Chorus)** 'Cause I ain't no porcelain doll on a Nashville music shelf And if you want a puppet, you can play it by yourself You can keep your contracts and your condescending class Yeah, you tell Chet Atkins he can kiss my Appalachian ass\!

**(Guitar Solo \- short, angry, and full of bent notes and feedback)**

**(Bridge)** They want my voice but not my words, my fire but not the smoke They wanna turn this wild-running river into some pathetic joke Well, I'd rather sing for truckers in a bar that smells like beer Than be the polished, soulless thing they're tryin' to make me here.

**(Outro \- Spoken, over a stumbling piano fade-out)** Yeah, you heard me. And buy your own damn shoes next time. This bourbon's too good to waste on a suit.

### 3\. Nashville Babylon

**Description:** *A slow, menacing, country-noir ballad at 65 BPM. The song slinks in on an upright bassline that walks through the verses like a private eye in a smoky bar. A tremolo-soaked electric guitar answers Rosie’s vocal lines with mournful, weeping phrases. The drums are barely there—just a whispered hi-hat and a ghostly cross-stick on the snare. Rosie’s vocal is a conspiratorial, bitter whisper, recorded dry and close to the mic, making every cynical observation feel like a shared, dangerous secret.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“It’s all fake. The whole damn town. I saw one of my heroes, a man who sings gospel on Sundays, passed out drunk with a girl half his age in his Lincoln Continental. I saw a ‘happily married’ duet act throwing glasses at each other backstage before they went out and sang about forever. They sell ‘three chords and the truth,’ but the truth is the one thing you can’t have. It’s a city built on beautiful lies. They’ll take your pain, shine it up, put it on a record, and leave you with the bill for the rhinestones. I used to think this was Jerusalem. Turns out it’s Babylon. And the writing is on the wall.”*

---

**(Song: Nashville Babylon)**

**(Intro \- Upright bassline walks alone for two bars, then joined by a single, tremolo-heavy guitar chord)**

**(Verse 1\)** The Saint of the Opry, with his Bible and his tie Keeps a bottle of pills in his boot heel on the sly He sings about redemption with a tear in his eye Then meets a different angel when the sun has left the sky And the Queen of the Airwaves, with a voice of pure spun gold Sings of forever love, but her own is bought and sold.

**(Chorus)** Welcome to Nashville Babylon, where the saints are made of rust Where they'll build you up with promises and bury you in dust They'll take your soul for a souvenir, your pain for a number one And smile right in your face until the dirty deed is done.

**(Verse 2\)** The biggest man at the label, he's a deacon at his church Left a girl from Chattanooga cryin' in the lurch She was singin' for a contract, he was lookin' for a thrill Another ghost with a guitar stranded at the foot of Music Hill Now she's waitressing on Broadway, humming what might have been And he's at a fancy dinner, committing another sin.

**(Chorus)** Welcome to Nashville Babylon, where the saints are made of rust Where they'll build you up with promises and bury you in dust They'll take your soul for a souvenir, your pain for a number one And smile right in your face until the dirty deed is done.

**(Bridge \- Electric guitar plays a lonely, bluesy melody over the bassline)**

**(Verse 3\)** They call me the wild one, the sinner, and the shame 'Cause I won't play their dirty little star-making game But I've seen the righteous crumble, I've seen the faithful fall And the biggest joke in this whole town is I'm the worst of them all I'd rather be a sinner who is honest in her rage Than a smiling hypocrite locked up in their golden cage.

**(Outro)** Yeah, welcome to Babylon… Don't let the rhinestones fool you... On your way down. **(Bass and guitar fade, leaving only the sound of a fading guitar tremolo)**

Of course. Here are the next three songs from Rosie Walker's notebook, continuing her story of leaving Nashville.

### 4\. The Prettiest Cage

**Description:** *A mid-tempo country-rock anthem of defiance at 120 BPM. This track has a stronger pulse than her earlier work, with a powerful, steady drum beat and a driving bassline that feels like a heart gathering courage. Twangy Telecaster guitars trade licks with a Hammond B3 organ, giving it a sound that bridges classic country with a tougher, blues-rock edge. Rosie's vocal is the centerpiece—not bitter, but soaring and determined. It's the sound of a decision being made in real-time.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“They gave me a brand new Cadillac last week. Pearl white. A ‘bonus’ for the last album going gold. I drove it out to Percy Priest Lake, parked, and just stared at the water. I thought about the first guitar I ever had, a beat-up Sears Silvertone my uncle gave me. I thought about how a new set of strings felt like the greatest luxury in the world. Now I have a car I’m scared to scratch and a closet full of rhinestone jackets I don’t even like. They give you just enough pretty things to make you forget you’re trapped. They praise your fire, then hand you a golden fire extinguisher. This isn't a life. It's a residency. A beautiful, comfortable, soul-crushing residency in the prettiest cage they could build. The bonus isn't the car. It's the realization that I can just leave the keys in it and walk away.”*

---

**(Song: The Prettiest Cage)**

**(Intro \- A driving drum beat and a confident, twangy guitar riff in G)**

**(Verse 1\)** They built this cage for me with bars of solid gold Gave me a velvet swing and a story to be told Dressed me up in diamonds, put a guitar in my hand Said, "Sing for us, little bird, you're the finest in the land." They painted a horizon on the wall behind my perch So I could sing of freedom without leaving their damn church.

**(Verse 2\)** They told me what to sing and they told me what to wear "Don't get too political, don't show you even care. Just smile for the cameras, girl, and hide your tangled wires, And we'll feed you fame and fortune to fuel your pretty fires." They loved the songs of heartbreak, they loved the songs of pain As long as I remembered to never name the names.

**(Chorus)** But the door was never locked, I just never thought to try Was so mesmerized by glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly This ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take This bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake 'Cause a cage is still a cage, no matter what it's made of.

**(Bridge)** They love a broken woman, they can sell her tragedy But a woman who knows her own mind is their worst catastrophe They can keep the golden bars and the high-society rage 'Cause a free bird in the mountains beats a queen in the prettiest cage. Yeah, a free bird in the mountains is turnin' her own page.

**(Guitar and Hammond Organ Solo \- energetic and liberating)**

**(Final Chorus)** Oh, the door was never locked, I just never dared to try Was so mesmerized by glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly This ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take This bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake\! Yeah, this bird is breaking out of the prettiest cage.

**(Outro \- Band holds a final chord, which fades out leaving just the sound of a single guitar note ringing with feedback)**

### 5\. Rhinestone Judas

**Description:** *A classic, slow-burning country heartbreak waltz in 3/4 time at 68 BPM. The track is drenched in sorrow, led by a weeping pedal steel guitar and a sparse, mournful piano that plays teardrop-like notes. A brushed snare and a quiet upright bass keep the waltz time. Rosie's vocal is weary and wounded, recorded with a touch of natural echo as if sung in a vast, empty hall. It cracks with raw emotion on the high notes, a masterful performance of betrayal.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Her name was Peggy. She came to town the same time I did, with a guitar case just as battered and eyes just as wide. We were roommates, sisters-in-arms. I got signed first, and I pulled her up with me. Got her a job singing backup, lent her money, gave her my songs when she was short on material. I told her everything. Told her about George, about the baby, about how I felt like I was suffocating. Last week, an executive at the label ‘suggested’ I take some time off for my ‘health.’ He knew things, intimate things, that only one person could have told him. Then I hear Peggy’s been given a solo spot on the big New Year’s Eve show. My spot. It wasn’t a knife in the back. It was a sequined glove, patting my shoulder as it pushed me off the ledge.”*

---

**(Song: Rhinestone Judas)**

**(Intro \- A single, sorrowful pedal steel note slides down, followed by a sparse piano melody in D)**

**(Verse 1\)** You borrowed my lipstick, you borrowed my car You were right there beside me at every cheap bar We were soldiers of fortune in this neon-lit war Swore we'd have each other's backs, and what's more, I told you my secrets, the dark and the deep The promises I couldn't possibly keep.

**(Verse 2\)** You smiled at my parties and drank all my wine Said, "Rosie, I'll have your back, sister, any old time." But when the rumors were flyin' and my name turned to mud You were the one holdin' the shovel and spillin' the blood You just nodded and listened, with a sad, tender grace While you were rehearsing to take over my place.

**(Chorus)** Oh, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls But you were just another ambitious girl I should've seen the envy hidin' in your eyes Beneath the hollow laughter and the gossamer lies You kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me for a song My Rhinestone Judas, I should've known all along.

**(Bridge \- Pedal steel solo, weeping over the slow waltz)** I hope you get that record deal, I hope you get the fame I hope every time you hear my music, you burn with the shame 'Cause you can't build a mansion on a foundation of sin And the ghost of my trust is a guest you'll be lettin' in For thirty silver dollars, or a spot on the stage You helped me write the final words on this gilded cage.

**(Final Chorus)** Yes, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls You were just the most clever of the ambitious girls I saw the hunger lurking there behind your pretty eyes Beneath the careful sympathy and well-rehearsed goodbyes You kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me for a song My Rhinestone Judas... God forgive me, I knew it all along.

**(Outro \- Piano plays a few final, sparse notes as the pedal steel holds a long, fading cry)**

### 6\. This Holler Holds My Name

**Description:** *A gentle, deeply nostalgic folk tune at 90 BPM. The song begins with just Rosie’s warm, clear vocal and her own finger-picked Martin D-28 acoustic guitar. The arrangement builds subtly; a soft, humming fiddle joins on the second verse, and a warm upright bass enters with the first chorus, providing a quiet, steady heartbeat. The mood is one of profound peace and homecoming, a quiet rejection of everything Nashville stood for.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Was looking at a copy of Music City News today. Saw my own face staring back at me under the headline ‘Rosie Walker: Queen of Country Soul.’ But that’s not my name. Rosie Walker is a costume. She’s a character I play for RCA Victor. My real name is Rose Marie Hatfield. It’s the name my mama whispered to me. It’s carved into the bark of a big beech tree by a creek in Pike County. That tree knows me better than anyone in this town. Rosie Walker belongs to Nashville. She can have it. Rose Marie Hatfield belongs to the mountains. And I’m finally ready to take her home.”*

---

**(Song: This Holler Holds My Name)**

**(Intro \- Simple, clean finger-picking on an acoustic guitar in C)**

**(Verse 1\)** They gave me a new name, they gave me a new town Put my face on a record that spun 'round and 'round Called me the "Bad Girl," the "Wild Child," the "Queen" But that ain't the woman I was ever meant to have been She's a stranger in a mirror, she's a well-rehearsed part With a rhinestone-covered surface where she used to have a heart.

**(Verse 2\)** 'Cause my soul ain't made of neon, my heart don't beat in time With the rhythm of the deal-makers on the Music Row line My blood runs thick with coal dust, my spirit with the pine And the face in all the magazines was never truly mine It was just a photograph of someone I agreed to be for pay.

**(Chorus)** But this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree The one my mama gave me, the one that sets me free The Cumberland River knows it, the mountain mist and rain I'm goin' back to the only truth that washes off the pain Rosie Walker's famous, but Rose Marie is home.

**(Bridge)** Let 'em wonder what happened to the girl with the green eyes Let 'em write their cautionary tales filled with rumors and with lies I'll be on a front porch swing, where the evening crickets drone Learning how to be myself again, and finally not alone With the ghosts of generations who knew this ground I'm on.

**(Final Chorus)** Yeah, this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree The one my daddy gave me, the one that sets me free The Cumberland River knows it, the mountains know it, too I'm goin' back to the only love I ever really knew Rosie Walker's fading, but Rose Marie is home.

**(Outro \- Acoustic guitar finger-picking slows and resolves on a final, peaceful C chord that rings out)**

### 7\. A Song for a Sparrow

**Description:** *An incredibly intimate and tender lullaby at 60 BPM. This is the rawest recording in the collection, featuring just Rosie and her acoustic guitar, recorded so closely you can hear the soft whisper of her fingers on the frets and the quiet intake of her breath. Her vocal is not a performance; it's a soft, loving murmur, full of the hope and fierce protectiveness of a mother-to-be. It’s a secret shared between two heartbeats.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Felt him kick for the first time today. Not a flutter, but a real, solid kick, right under my ribs as I was trying to write some throwaway line about a truck stop. It knocked the breath right out of me. I dropped the pen and just laid my hand on my stomach. In this whole loud, lying town, this is the only thing that’s real. This is my sparrow. I can’t let him be born here. I won’t let them turn his life into a tragedy they can sell on an album. His father is a legend, but he’s also a storm. A beautiful, brilliant storm that I can’t live in anymore, and I won’t raise a child in its path. This song isn’t for RCA. It’s not for the Opry. It’s just for him. So someday he’ll know this was never about running away from him. It was about running toward him.”*

---

**(Song: A Song for a Sparrow)**

**(Intro \- A few simple, gently finger-picked chords on an acoustic guitar, played softly in G)**

**(Verse 1\)** Hello in there, my sparrow, can you hear this old guitar? It's the only thing your mama's got that's followed her this far You're a secret that I'm keepin', a whisper in my soul A tiny spark of future that will finally make me whole And you're rolling like the thunder that your father always brings But I'm gonna teach you quiet, and the peace of silent things.

**(Verse 2\)** Your father's got a voice of angels, and a heart that's wild and loud He can make the heavens listen from the front row of a crowd But that world of smoke and stages ain't no place to learn to fly So we're headed for the mountains, little sparrow, you and I He gives away his pieces 'til there's nothing left to own And I won't let you be one more thing he has to leave alone.

**(Chorus)** And I will sing you songs of creeks and sleepy, sunlit dawns Not of barrooms, broken bottles, and the lovers who are gone You'll know the sound of whippoorwills before the Opry train And you'll grow up wild and sturdy, clean and honest as the rain This world can't have you, little one, this world is not our friend This is a mother's promise on which you can depend.

**(Bridge)** I don't have much to give you, just a trailer and a name A solemn vow to shield you from the burnin' of the fame And this beat-up old guitar for when you learn to find your own A better life is waitin' than the one I've ever known A quiet life, a steady life, a life that's truly real.

**(Outro)** Sleep now, little sparrow... let the mountains be your shield. Mama's taking you home. **(Guitar resolves on a soft G chord and fades)**

### 8\. The King of Broken Things

**Description:** *A grand, dramatic torch song at a funereal 55 BPM. This is Rosie's final goodbye to the Nashville sound and the man who embodied it for her. The track opens with a lonely piano, soon joined by swelling orchestral strings and a heart-wrenching pedal steel. Rosie's voice is at its most powerful and polished, a knowing nod to the Nashville production she is rejecting. It’s a performance filled with love, profound pity, and the cold, hard pain of a necessary amputation.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“He came by last night. Drunk, of course. Said he’d leave her, that he’d be the man I deserved. He sang me a new song he’d written, and for three minutes, he was the brilliant, beautiful man I fell in love with. Then he passed out on my couch. I put a blanket over him and sat there all night, just watching him. He’s a king. The king of heartbreak, the king of a sad country song. But his kingdom is made of glass, and he’s always the one holding the hammer. I love him. God help me, I will always love him. But you can’t save a man from his own throne. I wrote this while he slept. It's the last song I'll ever write about him. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to a clean goodbye.”*

---

**(Song: The King of Broken Things)**

**(Intro \- A spare, melancholy piano melody in C minor, joined by the sorrowful cry of a pedal steel)**

**(Verse 1\)** You wear a crown of neon, you hold a scepter of regret You're the undisputed sovereign of the ones we can't forget Your kingdom is a barstool, your castle's built on shame And every heart you conquer only learns to curse your name You rule a million jukeboxes, a million lonely nights Beneath the pale and buzzing glow of the cheap motel room lights.

**(Verse 2\)** You sang a song for me once, with a voice so pure and true For a moment, I saw the angel that was buried deep inside of you You built a world in three short minutes, a world I'd die to own Then you smashed it into pieces and left me there alone That's your most tragic talent, the one that sets you high apart You know just how to build a world before you break a heart.

**(Chorus)** So hail to the king of broken things, the lord of the last call The poet of the pieces after the great fall I loved you more than reason, but less than my own life And I can't be another jewel in the crown of your lonely strife Your throne is built on sorrow, your anthem is the blues And being just your empress is a role I must refuse.

**(Bridge \- Strings swell dramatically, carrying the melody as the pedal steel weeps)** They'll say I was the wild one who couldn't be controlled But the truth is, I was sober enough to see a story getting old You can't build a home inside a hurricane's eye And this was my one moment to say a real goodbye Before your beautiful destruction became my own.

**(Final Chorus)** So long live the king of broken things, in his castle made of pain The poet of the whiskey tears and the lonely, midnight rain I loved you more than my own soul, but less than the one I saved And I can't be another headstone on the path your sorrow paved. Long live the king... The lonely, lonely king of broken things.

**(Piano and pedal steel play a final, fading outro)**

### 9\. River of Ghosts

**Description:** *A haunting, atmospheric folk song with a non-traditional structure, set to a hypnotic 75 BPM. The track is built on the foundation of an open-tuned acoustic guitar, creating a droning, almost mystical rhythm. A low, mournful cello provides the bass notes, moving slowly beneath the guitar. There are no drums. Rosie’s vocal is chant-like and powerful, less a melody and more an incantation. It connects her personal story of escape to a much older, deeper story of survival and identity rooted in her Cherokee heritage.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Chet once told me to ‘smile more’ because my cheekbones were a ‘great asset.’ Said my grandmother must have been a real beauty. He had no idea. My grandma was a Hatfield, but her mama was Cherokee. She taught me things the Bible never did. About listening to the land. About how some rivers hold the memories of everyone who ever drank from them. Nashville tried to make me into a simple, digestible product. A ‘Country Rose.’ They celebrated the part of me that was white and pretty, and they told me to hide the rest. But the rest is the strongest part. It’s the part that knows how to survive. This isn’t just me leaving Nashville. It’s the river of my ancestors finally washing me clean and carrying me home.”*

---

**(Song: River of Ghosts)**

**(Intro \- Acoustic guitar in an open C tuning plays a repeating, droning, rhythmic pattern. A low cello note enters beneath it.)**

**(Verse 1\)** The man from the label, he looked at my face Said, "The cheekbones are great, but we gotta erase Any hint of the wildwood, the dark river's shore, We're selling a country rose, nothing less, nothing more." He gave me new boots and a name that felt wrong And told me to hide my grandmother's tongue in my songs.

**(Verse 2\)** But he don't know my grandma, with her hair long and black Who walked a trail of sorrow and never looked back She taught me that silence can be a warrior's shield And a woman's true strength is the truth she won't yield She said, "This world will try to name you, to claim you as its own, But you listen for the water, and you'll never be alone."

**(Chorus)** There's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins It sings of survival through droughts and through rains It's older than Nashville, it's stronger than fame And it's whisperin' to me, "Go remember your name." It's callin' me homeward, away from this place With the mud of the mountain still fresh on its face.

**(Bridge \- Cello plays a mournful, melodic solo line over the droning guitar)** They took our land, they took our tongue, they tried to take our soul But you can't kill a spirit that you cannot control And every time I sing a song of leavin' and of loss I'm singin' for the ancestors who paid the bitter cost This ain't no song of heartbreak, it's the paying of a debt To the women who kept walking, so I would not forget.

**(Final Chorus)** There's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins It sings of survival through droughts and through rains It's older than Nashville, it's stronger than fame And it's callin' me homeward, to remember my name. It's callin' me homeward, to wash myself clean From the woman I was... and the places I've been.

**(Outro \- The droning guitar and cello continue, slowly fading out like a river flowing into the distance)**

---

### 10\. Burn the Paper Dress

**Description:** *A sparse and percussive acoustic track at 110 BPM. The driving rhythm comes from Rosie's own hand hitting the body of her Martin guitar, creating a raw, determined heartbeat. Her acoustic guitar plays a simple, repeating riff in a minor key. There are no other instruments except for her voice, which is layered in a simple, self-made harmony on the chorus. It’s not a song of anger, but of ritual and cleansing.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“Packed tonight. One suitcase. Filled it with my daddy’s flannel shirts, two pairs of jeans, a book of poems, and the notebook. The rest of it… the Nudie suits, the rhinestone dresses, the fan mail… I piled it all in the middle of the floor of this apartment that RCA pays for. It looked like a shrine to a dead woman. I found the publicity photos for the last album. The ones where they put me in that white, frilly paper-looking dress and told me to look ‘vulnerable.’ I was playing a part, wearing a costume made of paper. It was never real. I took a match and lit the corner of one of the photos. Then I tossed it on the pile. There’s no going back when the bridges are ash.”*

**(Song: Burn the Paper Dress)**

**(Intro \- A single, repeating acoustic guitar riff in A-minor, with a percussive slap on the guitar body on the 2 and 4 beats)**

**(Verse 1\)** The woman in the magazines, she's got my eyes, my mouth She's smiling for the camera as she's headin' ever south They put her in a paper dress, a crown of paper lies And told her she was queen of all the things that she despised She sold her pain for pennies, she sold her ghost for gold And did every single thing the men in power told.

**(Verse 2\)** Tonight I read her letters, the ones from girls back home Who said her voice had saved them from feelin' all alone And for a single second, a sadness cut me through For killing off the only saint they ever thought they knew But that saint was just a story, a well-constructed myth And I can't live inside a cage of someone else's wish.

**(Chorus)** So I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame Every single article that ever wrote my name I'm pilin' up the evidence of a life that wasn't mine And offerin' the whole damn thing up to the turpentine Let the fire take the fake girl, let the smoke forget the rest Tonight I burn the paper doll, tonight I burn the dress.

**(Bridge)** They'll say I lost my mind, or I ran off with a man They'll never understand it was the only sane plan You can't just walk away from a ghost that wears your face You have to perform an exorcism to leave the haunted place.

**(Final Chorus)** So I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame Every single article that ever wrote my name I'm pilin' up the evidence of a life that wasn't mine And offerin' the whole damn thing up to the turpentine Let the fire take the fake girl, let the smoke obscure the rest Tonight I burn the paper doll... tonight I burn the dress.

**(Outro \- The percussive slapping and the guitar riff continue for a few bars then stop abruptly)**

### 11\. The Ghost in the Radio

**Description:** *A haunting, ethereal ballad at a slow 70 BPM. The sound is drenched in the echo and reverb of a classic 1960s recording, but the instrumentation is minimal: a lonely, tremolo-heavy electric guitar plays a simple arpeggio, while a brushed snare and a stand-up bass keep a quiet, swaying rhythm. Rosie’s vocal is distant and soft, as if she’s already broadcasting from somewhere far away. It is her final reflection on the persona she is about to abandon.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“It’s 2 AM at the Greyhound station. The bus to Kentucky leaves in ten minutes. My song came on the little transistor radio the ticket-taker has on his counter. ‘Baptized in Bourbon.’ It sounds like it was sung by a different person. A loud, brave, broken girl I used to know. It’s a strange thought, that for the rest of my life, that girl will still be out there. She’ll be singing in bars I’m not in, coming out of radios in cars I’ll never see. I’m leaving, but she has to stay. I’m setting her free to be a ghost, a story. From tomorrow on, she’s not my problem. She’s just a voice in the air.”*

**(Song: The Ghost in the Radio)**

**(Intro \- A slow, tremolo-soaked electric guitar arpeggio in E-minor)**

**(Verse 1\)** The neon sign is humming a sad and lonely tune Reflected in a puddle beneath a cloudy moon The man behind the counter is listenin' to my song About a girl who got it right by gettin' everything wrong He's tappin' out the rhythm, he doesn't look at me He doesn't see the person that I no longer want to be.

**(Verse 2\)** That girl, she's full of whiskey, she's full of cheap regret She's a three-minute distraction from a life you ain't lived yet She'll sing you through the night shift, she'll get you through the drive She'll make you feel for just a spell, a little more alive She's everything they made her, she's brave and she's a mess And I'm the only one who knows it's all a wilderness.

**(Chorus)** And soon that's all I'll be, a memory in a wire A disembodied voice that's for public rent and hire Singin' 'bout a heartbreak from a million miles away From the woman I'll be living as, starting from today Let her sing forever, let her tear her heart in two The ghost in the radio has nothing more to do with you.

**(Bridge)** She'll always be nineteen, with a fire in her eyes She'll never have to compromise, she'll never have to lie She's frozen in the amber of a three-chord tragedy And the greatest gift I give her is to finally set her free.

**(Outro)** Yeah, the bus is pulling out now, leaving her behind A story on the airwaves, a comfort for the kind Who need to hear a sad song... from the ghost in the radio. **(The tremolo guitar holds a final, shimmering chord that slowly fades to silence)**

### 12\. First Day of My Life

**Description:** *A simple, unadorned folk hymn. The only sound is Rosie’s voice and her acoustic guitar, playing a straightforward chord progression reminiscent of a Carter Family song. Her vocal is quiet, clear, and utterly devoid of Nashville artifice. It’s not sad, it’s not angry; it’s calm and full of a quiet, dawning hope. This is the last song in the notebook, the sound of a woman taking her first breath of free air.*

**Rosie's Rough Notes/Story:** *“The sun is coming up over the Cumberland Gap. The bus crossed the state line into Kentucky about ten minutes ago. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a prettier sunrise. All pink and orange over the mountains that raised me. I’m not Rosie Walker anymore. I’m not even Rose Marie Hatfield yet. I’m just a woman on a bus, with a baby in her belly and a guitar in her lap. I don’t know what happens next. For the first time, I have no contract, no tour dates, no expectations. There’s no map. It’s terrifying. And it’s the most wonderful feeling in the world. This is it. Page one.”*

**(Song: First Day of My Life)**

**(Intro \- A simple, steady acoustic guitar strumming a C-G-F-C progression)**

**(Verse 1\)** The glass is cold against my head, the engine makes a groan The diesel fumes are smellin' like the seeds of goin' home The sun is just a rumor on the black and hazy line Of the mountains of Kentucky that have always been all mine. The driver doesn't know me, and I don't know his name Just two more weary travelers in a long and tired game.

**(Verse 2\)** My hands ain't full of diamonds, my boots ain't made of hide There's nothin' in my suitcase that I have any need to hide Got a notebook full of goodbyes, and a heart that's full of prayer And a ticket in my pocket that could take me anywhere But it's only taking me to where I should have been right from the start.

**(Chorus)** And the sun comes up like absolution, orange, pink, and bright And I feel a generation's worth of darkness turn to light I take a breath and watch the frost melt off the window pane And I hear the quiet whisper of the gently fallin' rain The past is just a story someone else will have to write 'Cause this is the first morning of the first day of my life.

**(Bridge)** No more songs of leavin', no more songs of bein' wronged No more songs of tryin' to find the place where I belong I'm already there.

**(Final Chorus)** And the sun comes up like absolution, orange, pink, and bright And I feel a generation's worth of darkness turn to light I take a breath and watch the frost melt off the window pane And I hear the quiet whisper of the gently fallin' rain The past is just a story someone else will get to write 'Cause this is the first morning of the first day of my life.

**(Outro \- The simple C-G-F-C progression repeats twice and ends on a clean, final C chord)**
