## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The barn light flickers like a lazy firefly
Moon’s hangin’ low in the denim sky
Your hand in mine, a comfort I crave
Dirt under our boots, where our future's paved
No diamonds here, just the earth and sky above
But I’ve got my roots, and I’ve got your love

[Pre-Chorus]
A tin band shines in the glow of the night
Simple and plain, but burnin' ever so bright
No gold to spare, no fortune to hold
But it feels so right, a story to be told

[Chorus]
A ring made of tin, a symbol true
The greatest thing, me and you
It ain’t the metal, so cold and bare
It’s the love it brings, beyond compare
No shiny stones, no fancy hue to see
But it’s perfect ‘cause it’s with you and me

[Verse 2]
We’ve got fields of dreams and a rusty old truck
Two hearts that bloom where the soil’s stuck
The cows don’t care, about carats or price
The crickets still sing, beneath the starry ice
Who needs a fortune when you’ve got this ring,
A simple promise, a beautiful thing?

[Bridge]
Some chase the glitter, the sparkle and shine
But true love's a river, a timeless design
A heart made of gold, a spirit so free
That's the real treasure, for you and for me

[Pre-Chorus]
A tin band shines, it don’t need a crown
Just a simple circle, that won’t let us down
It’s the promise we’ve got that won’t wear down
In this small town.

[Chorus]
A ring made of tin, a symbol true
The greatest thing, me and you
It ain’t the metal, so cold and bare
It’s the love it brings, beyond compare
No shiny stones, no fancy hue to see
But it’s perfect ‘cause it’s with you and me

[Outro]
A ring made of tin, just a simple band
The truest love, in this promised land.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked intro and strummed rhythm), fiddle (subtle accents in verses and soaring melody in bridge), upright bass or acoustic bass guitar (provides warm, grounding rhythm), light percussion (brushes on snare, minimal kick drum). Tempo: Moderate, slightly relaxed. Vocal delivery: Warm, sincere, and slightly vulnerable. The song should build slightly in intensity towards the second chorus and bridge. Consider adding a mandolin for additional texture. The fiddle solo in the bridge should be emotive and lyrical, capturing the feeling of enduring love. Backing vocals (harmonies) during the choruses can enhance the song's emotional impact.
