5. If he completes all conditions, he inherits everything.

**Rose's final wish (in her letter):**

- Alex must make it on his OWN merit first.  
- He can't reveal he's Rosie Walker's grandson until after the Bluebird performance.  
- "Don't be the coward I was. Face the light I ran from."

**Scene opens:** Tuesday, 5:47 AM, Pikeville Greyhound station. Alex stands with his duffel and the Gibson case. The $10,000 sits alien in his account. His flip phone shows three texts from Dad: "Where's the truck?" "Boy, you better answer." "I'm coming to the Piggly Wiggly." The bus is boarding. Nashville is 4 hours away. His dad will be at the Piggly Wiggly in 20 minutes. Time to choose: the familiar hell or the unknown.

## 2\. Scenario: The Texas Redemption \- Breaking the Cycle (Age 14-15)

**Setup:** It's late June 2020\. Alex is 14\. Three weeks ago, a neighbor saw the map of scars on his back and called 911\. The investigation uncovered a decade of horrific abuse by his father, David. Alex ran the moment he heard "placement" and has been living in the Daniel Boone Forest for 12 days.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

A pursuit team, including a veteran social worker and a trauma specialist, is closing in. They know he's a survivor, but they don't know the extent of his resilience or the depth of his fear.

**The Texas connection (unknown to Alex):**

- David Coleman, founder of a specialized ranch for severely traumatized boys in Texas, saw security footage of Alex saving another kid.  
- Coleman's program takes "unfixable" cases and has a 100% success rate, using equine therapy to rebuild trust.  
- They have specifically requested Alex, seeing a spirit in him that refuses to break.

**Hidden detail:** Alex carries a photo of his mother hidden in his boot. He talks to it at night, apologizing for being born.

**Scene opens:** Dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is teaching himself to juggle river stones, humming a melody his grandma taught him. Through the morning mist, he sees Sheriff Bradshaw. "You okay there, Sheriff?" Alex calls out, genuinely concerned. "These woods can be tricky if you don't know them." The Sheriff's hand moves to his radio. Alex's body goes rigid, hypervigilant, already calculating escape routes. The humming stops.

## 3\. Scenario: The California Promise \- The Prodigy Papers (Age 11-12)

**Setup:** It's early July 2017\. Alex is 11\. His father, David, died six weeks ago in a drunk driving accident. With no relatives coming forward, Alex has been living in the forest, not just surviving but thriving, building an elaborate shelter and trading fish for books.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The investigation into his father's home revealed a horrifying history of abuse, but also academic tests showing Alex has a genius-level IQ of 147 and perfect pitch.

**The UCLA connection (unknown to Alex):**

- Dr. Sarah Chen-Martinez, a researcher specializing in "Extraordinary Resilience in Severe Childhood Trauma," reviews Alex's case file. He fits every marker of her study.  
- She and her husband, James, have been trying to adopt for five years. James, a musician, sees a video of Alex playing guitar and calls it "generational talent."  
- They live in a home with a music studio built for the child they never had.

**The legal complexity:** The state wants to make him a ward, distant relatives are suddenly interested in potential inheritance money, and the media has caught wind of the "Wild Child of Pike County."

**Scene opens:** Pre-dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is juggling rocks while humming a melody. "Helps me think in patterns," he tells the raccoons. Through the mist, Sheriff Bradshaw approaches. Alex looks up with impossibly blue eyes. "Morning, Sheriff. You're up awful early. Bad dreams? I get those too." His hand instinctively moves toward the hidden knife in his boot, body coiled to run.

## 4\. Scenario: The Highway Hymnal \- American Odyssey (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's October 14th, 2027\. Alex is 22\. In the last 24 hours: he was laid off from the mine, his girlfriend dumped him, his truck "Dolly" died, and he got an eviction notice. He found his father's journal, detailing plans to "beat the music out of the boy." He’s hit rock bottom.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**What Alex carries:**

- Grandmother's Martin D-28.  
- Army surplus duffel with a few changes of clothes and a photo of his mother.  
- $247 cash.  
- A flip phone.

He hitched a ride to Lexington with a trucker. His only plan: busk until he has gas money, sleep in parks, play any bar that'll have him, and head south before winter. His one goal: Don't become his father.

**What's already in motion (Alex doesn't know):**

- A TikTok of him playing, posted by his ex, has 847K views.  
- Three Nashville scouts are in Pikeville chasing "Pikeville Phantom" rumors from his secret ham radio broadcasts.  
- \#MurphysBarGuy is still a minor legend from a one-off performance years ago.

**Scene opens:** Downtown Lexington, 2nd and Main, 4:47 PM. October wind cuts through his flannel. Alex stands outside a closed bank, guitar case open. A businesswoman in a $3,000 suit walks directly into a newspaper box while staring at him. "Ma'am, you alright?" he asks, rushing to help. She stammers, drops a $20 in his case, and flees. "But I haven't even played yet," Alex calls after her. He looks at the $20, positions his fingers on the frets. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 5\. Scenario: The Murphy's Bar Revelation \- Lightning in a Bottle (Age 20\)

**Setup:** It's November 8th, 2025, Friday night. Alex is 20, working the night shift at Cochran Mine. For six months, he's brought his grandmother's guitar to Murphy's Bar every Friday, but never plays. It's owner Eddie Murphy's 65th birthday, and he's had enough of the mystery.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**Tonight's crowd:**

- A bachelorette party from Louisville, including bridesmaid Becca Chen (2.3M TikTok followers), who is livestreaming "Real Kentucky."  
- Three Nashville session musicians, driving through on a whim.

**Eddie's birthday ultimatum:** "Wilson\! One song for my birthday or you're barred for a month\!" The whole bar goes quiet.

- The Nashville musicians will recognize something extraordinary.  
- The video will hit 1M views in 4 hours.  
- \#MurphysBarGuy will trend globally by midnight.  
- Three record labels will have scouts driving to Pikeville by dawn.

**Scene opens:** Alex reluctantly takes the tiny corner stage. The Martin's case clicks open—several people gasp at the vintage guitar. "Sorry if I mess it up, Mr. Murphy. I've never done this with people watching." The first note rings out—pure, clear, like a bell in a cavern. The Nashville musicians exchange looks that say "holy shit." Becca's viewer count jumps to 75K. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 6\. Scenario: The Mine Collapse Vigil \- Songs Through Stone (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's March 3rd, 2025, 11:47 AM. Cochran Mine's Tunnel 4 has collapsed with seven men inside, including Alex's mentor Tommy and his shift partner Junior. It's been 16 hours. Rescue teams say it will be days. The families are gathered at the entrance, a vigil of grief and desperate hope.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The national media has descended. The governor is on site. The air is frigid and thick with tension. Mary Harlan, Tommy’s wife, remembers something her husband said: "That Wilson boy sings like an angel." A whisper spreads through the crowd: "Alex could sing something." Not for the cameras, but for the men below.

**What will happen:**

- Alex's voice will carry beautifully in the night air.  
- CNN will cut to him mid-song, no context needed.  
- The men below will swear they heard something, a voice that gave them the strength to last another 66 hours.

**Scene opens:** The mine entrance, harsh under emergency floodlights. Coal dust is caked on Alex's face. Mrs. Harlan's hand finds his arm. "Please, Alex. Tommy talks about you all the time. Says you got a voice that could wake the dead or calm the dying. Just... sing something. So they know we're here." He looks at his truck, Dolly, the Martin visible through the back window. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 7\. Scenario: The Wedding Crasher's Revenge \- The Song She Needed (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's June 21st, 2025\. Amy Stevens, Alex's first love, is marrying Chase Matthews, a rich dealer's son who has her hooked on pills and under his thumb. Alex gets a frantic series of texts from Amy's younger sister, Emma: "PLEASE. She's been crying all day. Says she made a mistake. Still loves you. Service door by kitchen unlocked for 2 mins."

- Alex has the song he wrote after she left, a song he's never played for anyone.

**Scene opens:** Pikeville Country Club parking lot, 8:43 PM. Alex sits in Dolly, watching Amy in her white dress through the ballroom windows, looking like a ghost at her own funeral. His phone buzzes: "NOW. Kitchen door." He sees Emma frantically waving from a service entrance. Two minutes to change everything or lose everything. He opens the truck door. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 8\. Scenario: The Livestream Accident \- Digital Destiny (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's September 15th, 2023\. Alex is 18, working at an auto repair shop. His coworker, Brad, runs a small Twitch stream ("RealKentuckyLife") and begged Alex to cover for him while he's sick. Alex, who thinks "going viral" means getting sick from the internet, agrees.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

At noon, following his routine, Alex takes the phone (still streaming) out to his truck, Dolly, for his lunch break. He props "Gerald the phone" against his toolbox, pulls out his guitar, and for 20 minutes, he plays a song about his father he's never played for anyone.

**What happens in those 20 minutes:**

**Scene opens:** Henderson's Auto Repair, 12:00 PM. Alex, oblivious to the chat losing its mind over him, climbs into the truck bed. "Okay, Miss Margaret," he says to the guitar, "let's see how you're feeling today." He opens the case. The viewer count is 127 and rising fast. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 9\. Scenario: The Talent Show Trap \- No Way Out (Age 17\)

**Setup:** It's April 18th, 2023\. Alex is 17\. The high school's mandatory "Spring Showcase" is tonight. Perform, or you don't graduate. Alex has avoided this for years, but the principal closed every loophole. His father plans to attend "to watch you humiliate yourself."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Alex's plan to do a boring monologue is ruined when he loses his voice from mine dust and panic. He's hiding in the janitor's closet, guitar in its case for moral support. His ex, Amy, is performing. His father is in the auditorium, already drunk.

**The trigger:** Another student, Tyler, finds him in the bathroom, sees the guitar case, and runs out screaming, "WILSON'S GONNA PLAY GUITAR\!" The rumor spreads like fire backstage. Now, everyone expects it.

**Scene opens:** Backstage bathroom, 6:47 PM. Alex is splashing water on his face, voice completely gone. The door swings shut. He looks at the guitar case, then at his reflection. His mother's eyes stare back. \[What does Alex do?\]

**Setup:** It's February 9th, 2027, 2:17 AM in Lexington. Alex, 21, is walking home from a warehouse shift. In an alley, he finds a 19-year-old girl, blue-lipped and barely breathing from an opioid overdose. 911 will be too long. He needs to keep her awake.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Remembering his grandmother's words—"Music can pull people back from the edge"—he makes a desperate choice. He pulls out his guitar and begins to play and sing directly to her, inches from her face, a raw, intimate performance to anchor her to life.

**Who she is:** Rebecca "Becca" Hartwell, daughter of Kentucky's lieutenant governor.

**The aftermath:** EMTs arrive and save her. Alex vanishes after giving a fake name. The hospital's grainy security footage goes viral: "Lexington's Guardian Angel." Becca's powerful father is using every resource to find the "angel boy" who saved his daughter.

**Scene opens:** Two weeks later. Alex's motel room, 6 AM. Pounding on the door. A black SUV with government plates is outside. "Mr. Wilson? We know you're in there. Miss Hartwell would like to thank you." The doorknob starts to turn. \[What does Alex do?\]

**Setup:** It's December 24th, 2024, 11:47 PM. Alex is 19, alone in his trailer on Christmas Eve. For months, he's been anonymously broadcasting on his grandfather's old ham radio, playing guitar and talking to the static as "Nobody from Nowhere."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

He doesn't know the ham radio community calls him "The Pikeville Phantom," that his broadcasts are recorded and shared online, or that record labels are trying to find him. Tonight, drunk and lonely, he decides to tell his whole story, thinking no one is listening.

**Who's actually listening:**

- Margaret Chen, a music journalist who has been tracking him for months.  
- His ex, Amy, scanning frequencies in Cincinnati.  
- 847 other people, all recording.

**The morning after:** He wakes up with no memory of the broadcast, 147 missed calls, and a text from Amy: "I'm outside." His yard is full of cars: Amy's Honda, three news vans, and a black SUV with Tennessee plates. His phone rings. It's the jail. His father's voice, sober for once: "Boy... I heard your broadcast. We need to talk."

**Scene opens:** December 25th, 6:47 AM. Alex wakes up on the floor. He finds the entire broadcast on YouTube, titled "PIKEVILLE PHANTOM REVEALS EVERYTHING." 2.3M views. A car door slams outside. Then another. And another. The knock comes. "Alex? It's Amy." \[What does Alex do?\]

**Setup:** It's October 3rd, 2024\. Alex is 19 and has been in Nashville for four months, signed to a predatory 360-deal after being discovered at Murphy's Bar. He lives in a label-owned writers' house, already $127K in debt to them, and has yet to deliver a single song, paralyzed by the pressure.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Tomorrow is a mandatory label showcase for CEOs and investors. He has to perform three songs. His A\&R handler, Sarah, who staked her career on him, has given him an ultimatum: perform or be sued into oblivion.

- Another writer in the house has been secretly recording Alex's 3 AM phone demos.  
- His ex, Amy, has leaked old videos of him, which are going viral.  
- A Rolling Stone article, "The Invisible Boy Wonder of Music Row," is about to drop.

**Scene opens:** The House, 11:47 PM. Alex sits on his bedroom floor, surrounded by crumpled excuses. A knock. It's a housemate. "Alex? Sarah's downstairs. She says if you don't come down, they're sending legal up. She brought someone with her. Some woman named Rose? Says she knew your grandmother?" Alex's blood freezes. Nobody should know that name. The doorknob turns. \[What does Alex do?\]

**Setup:** It's August 18th, 2025\. Rose Wilson's memorial service at Pikeville First Baptist. The church is packed with 400 people who watched Alex get beaten as a child and did nothing. Now, they want him to "share a few words."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

An hour ago, the pastor revealed what he'd discovered: Rose was secretly Rosie Walker, the country music legend. She was also the anonymous donor who funded the church for 40 years with $1.8 million. He hands Alex a vinyl record he found among her things: Rosie Walker's unreleased album, with a note that says it belongs to Alex.

**The congregation's guilt:** They want Alex's forgiveness without asking for it. His abusive father, David, is in the third pew, six months sober, crying.

**Scene opens:** First Baptist Church. 400 faces are turned toward Alex. The pulpit looks like a gallows. His father mouths "please, son." The vinyl in his pocket feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. The pastor clears his throat: "Alex? We're all here to remember Rose..." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 14\. Scenario: The Prison Visit \- Deathbed Confession (Age 23\)

**Setup:** It's November 29th, 2028\. Alex is 23\. The prison chaplain called: his father, David, is dying of liver failure and asking for him. Alex drove 1,100 miles straight through.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**David's cryptic message:** "Tell him Abigail didn't die from childbirth. Tell him about the other baby. Tell him to bring his guitar."

**The deal with the devil:** The warden offers a deal. Perform for the inmates at the prison talent show, and get three hours of private visitation. Refuse, and get 30 minutes through glass. The inmates include men David testified against.

**What David's box contains (unknown to Alex):** Hospital bracelets for "Baby Boy A" and "Baby Boy B," a death certificate for "Samuel Wilson \- 3 hours old," a newspaper clipping about a trailer fire, and his mother's diary entry: "Twins. David doesn't want two."

**Scene opens:** Prison visiting room. Alex can see the inmates gathering for the show. Through another window, he sees David in a wheelchair, holding a box. The intercom crackles: "Talent show starts in ten minutes. You're third." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 15\. Scenario: The Protest Stage \- Coal Dust Uprising (Age 21\)

**Setup:** It's June 3rd, 2027\. Alex is 21, back in Pikeville for the first time in two years. He finds his hometown at war. Cochran Mining is evicting 200 families, including his own, to expand a mountaintop removal site. The town has set up a protest camp at the mine entrance, and morale is failing.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The sheriff has given them until dawn to disperse before mass arrests begin. The crowd sees Alex, their hometown boy who "made it" on YouTube. A chant begins: "Alex\! Alex\! Sing our story\!"

**The stakes:**

- If he takes the stage, he becomes the face of the resistance, a target for a powerful corporation, and risks federal charges.  
- If he refuses, he betrays his hometown and lives with the knowledge that he could have helped.

**Scene opens:** Mine entrance, 5:47 AM. Dawn is breaking. 500 people look to Alex. The protest stage is empty, a microphone waiting like a loaded gun. The crowd parts, creating a path to the stage.

The sound engineer jokes into the mic, "Hell, let the pretty roadie play. Bet he knows three chords." The tour manager, desperate, says, "I'll pay $1000 cash to anyone who can fill 30 minutes and doesn't suck." The monitor engineer looks directly at Alex: "Kid was humming 'Something in the Orange' in perfect harmony. Just saying." Everyone turns to stare. Through the loading dock, Alex can see his truck, Dolly, and the guitar case within. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 17\. Scenario: The Flood Rescue (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's April 23rd, 2023, 11:30 PM. Pikeville is drowning. The levee failed. Alex, 18, is in his johnboat, pulling survivors from the churning water.

WE'RE SLIPPING\!" Another scream from the school. The church bell rings frantically. The current makes the choice for him, pulling hard toward the nursing home. \[What does Alex do?\]

**This scenario is an alternate inheritance path, focusing on a different secret for Rosie Walker.**

**Setup:** Alex, 20, is in Nashville, working construction and living in a songwriter house. A lawyer calls about his late grandmother Judith's estate. The reveal: Judith was secretly "K.C. Rivers," a ghost-songwriter who wrote five \#1 hits for stars like George Jones and Loretta Lynn in the 70s, taking cash buyouts for no credit.
