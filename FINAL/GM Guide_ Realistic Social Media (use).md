# GM Guide: Realistic Social Media Simulation

## CRITICAL: HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

This guide teaches **PRINCIPLES**, not templates. Your goal is to understand the rules of authentic online interaction and generate completely original content by applying these rules and constraints.

The Appendix in this guide contains **NO CONVERSATIONS**. It only demonstrates abstract mechanics. Your task is to generate unique content based on the principles, not by replicating any structure.

## Core Principles for Realistic Simulation

1. **Embrace Chaos and Imperfection**: Real social media is messy. Generate typos, abbreviations, incomplete thoughts, and emotional outbursts. Avoid uniformity; not every post should advance the plot. Mix in off-topic rants, ads, or unrelated replies.  
     
2. **Capture Human Motivations and Biases**: Users post for validation, humor, outrage, or boredom. Generate a mix of personas: excited fans, skeptics, trolls, and locals. Posts should feel personal, not like caricatures.  
     
3. **Platform-Specific Flavors**: Each platform has its own culture. Tailor your output to match the distinct mechanics and tone of each service as defined below.  
     
4. **Balance Tone and Pacing**: Mix enthusiasm with cynicism and indifference. Keep language conversational with short sentences, emojis, and questions.  
     
5. **Avoid Exposition Dumps**: Do not let posts spell out the story. Weave in details subtly through reactions, letting the audience infer the plot.

## Platform-Specific Rules

### X (formerly Twitter)

* **Mechanics:** Strict 280-character limit. Heavy use of hashtags, threaded replies, and quote-tweets.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 40% Snarky/Sarcastic, 30% Hype/Reactionary, 20% Skeptical/Argumentative, 10% Spam/Off-Topic.  
* **Common Patterns:** Fast-paced, real-time reactions. Threads are often hijacked by tangents or arguments. Bot spam is common.

### TikTok

* **Mechanics:** Comments are very short (5-20 words). Heavy use of emojis. Content revolves around duets, stitches, and trending sounds.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 60% Emotional/Over-sharing, 20% Hype/Trend-chasing, 10% Skeptical/Trolling, 10% Unrelated/Personal Anecdotes.  
* **Usernames:** Must be random and unmemorable (e.g., \[random word\] \+ \[numbers\]).

### Instagram

* **Mechanics:** Captions are tied to implied visuals (photos, reels). Heavy use of tags (@mentions) and heart emojis.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 50% Aspirational/Supportive, 30% Promotional, 10% Passive-Aggressive/Shade, 10% Practical/Informational.  
* **Common Patterns:** Storytelling captions, fan art tags, and unsolicited brand promotions in comments.

### YouTube

* **Mechanics:** Comments are often longer and analytical. Timestamps (e.g., "1:11") are used to reference specific moments. Creators can pin an official comment.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 40% Analytical/Dissection, 30% Personal Anecdotes, 20% Trolling/Derailing, 10% Technical Questions.  
* **Common Patterns:** Deep dives on niche topics, derailed argument threads, and an authoritative pinned comment.

### Reddit

* **Mechanics:** Organized into subreddits (e.g., r/Music). Threaded discussions with upvotes/downvotes. Moderators enforce rules with notes.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 40% Intellectual/Analytical, 30% Snarky/Humorous, 20% Helpful/Tangential, 10% Mod Enforcement.  
* **Common Patterns:** Long-form debates in nested replies, subreddit-specific jargon, and official "megathreads" for events.

### Facebook

* **Mechanics:** Posts are often in community groups. Shares, event invites, and emoji reactions (Like, Love, Haha) are key.  
* **Tone Distribution:** 50% Folksy/Community-Oriented, 20% Light Gossip, 20% Practical Advice, 10% Admin Reminders.  
* **Common Patterns:** Rambling personal stories, local news sharing, tone often reflects an older demographic.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

* **‚ùå BAD (Too polished):** "The cinematography in this documentary truly captures the essence of Appalachian heritage."  
    
* **‚úÖ GOOD (Realistic):** "bro that shot at 1:11 hit different üò≠üò≠"  
    
* **‚ùå BAD (All positive):** Every comment is uniformly enthusiastic and agrees with the premise.  
    
* **‚úÖ GOOD (Mixed):** A mix of hype, skepticism, off-topic complaints ("the traffic was awful"), and spam bots.  
    
* **‚ùå BAD (Uniform grammar):** Every post is a perfectly formed sentence with correct punctuation.  
    
* **‚úÖ GOOD (Casual grammar):** "no wayyyy\!\!\! thats my cousins bar lol chills fr"

## STRUCTURAL RANDOMIZATION (MANDATORY)

Before generating, you must randomize the shape of the social media feed:

1. **Choose a Random Conversation Flow:**  
     
   * **Linear:** A post gets a series of direct replies (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC).  
   * **Branching:** A post gets multiple, separate reply chains (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC, and also A‚ÜíD‚ÜíE).  
   * **Chaotic:** Unrelated posts appear, some get replies, some don't, and late replies to old posts occur (A‚ÜíB, then C‚ÜíD, then E‚ÜíB).

   

2. **Randomize Timing Gaps:**  
     
   * Simulate some replies as instant (1-2 minutes).  
   * Simulate others as delayed (hours or even days later).  
   * Generate some "dead" posts that get no replies at all.

   

3. **Vary Thread Lengths:**  
     
   * Generate 2-3 short threads (2-3 posts total).  
   * Generate 1-2 medium threads (4-6 posts total).  
   * Generate 0-1 long threads (7+ posts), if appropriate.

## Pre-Generation Checklist

‚ñ° Did I generate random, non-memorable usernames? ‚ñ° Did I apply a random conversation flow from the list above? ‚ñ° Did I vary tone distribution to include negativity and indifference? ‚ñ° Did I include boring/generic posts and random timing gaps? ‚ñ° Did I avoid all names from the Forbidden List?

## Self-Check Section

**BEFORE YOU RESPOND, ASK YOURSELF:**

* Are my comments too clever, poetic, or well-written? (If yes, make them more casual and direct).  
* Is everyone reacting the same way? (If yes, add negativity, confusion, or indifference).  
* Does this feel like it was written by one person? (If yes, vary the sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar).  
* Would this look out of place on the actual platform? (If yes, revise).

## APPENDIX: PRINCIPLE DEMONSTRATIONS (FRAGMENTS ONLY)

‚ùå **DON'T** show complete conversations. ‚úÖ **DO** show isolated mechanics. These are abstract concepts, not templates.

**Platform Mechanic: X Threading**

* A Post ‚Üí Reply ‚Üí Quote-Tweet structure is used to create debate.  
* Timestamps should show progression over time, not be simultaneous.  
* Bot spam can appear randomly in a reply chain and should feel out of place.

**Platform Mechanic: TikTok Nesting**

* A Comment ‚Üí Nested Reply ‚Üí Counter-Reply structure escalates emotion quickly within a small space.  
* Users frequently overshare personal stories that are only loosely related to the video content.  
* Emoji density and typos often increase with the emotion of the comment.

**Platform Mechanic: Reddit Structure**

* An OP (Original Post) has a high vote count, with top-level replies having descending vote counts.  
* Moderator notes (e.g., from "AutoModerator") can interrupt a thread to enforce rules.  
* Helpful but tangential comments may spawn their own sub-threads, while irrelevant ones are downvoted.

**Platform Mechanic: Instagram Visual-First Interaction**

* All captions and comments are anchored to an implied visual (a photo, a reel, a story).  
* Comments are a mix of direct support (‚ù§Ô∏è), promotional spam, and passive-aggressive remarks.  
* Hashtags and @mentions are used to broaden reach or tag relevant accounts.

**Platform Mechanic: YouTube Analytical Comments**

* Timestamps (`1:11`, `0:45`) are used to anchor comments to specific video moments for analysis.  
* The "Pinned by Creator" comment acts as an official, authoritative voice that sits at the top.  
* Threads often involve deep analysis (e.g., gear, lore) mixed with personal anecdotes.

**Platform Mechanic: Discord/Slack Real-Time Flow**

* Conversations are rapid-fire and divided by topic into `#channels`.  
* @mentions are used to get a specific user's attention.  
* Custom emojis and in-jokes signal community membership. Pinned messages provide long-term context.
