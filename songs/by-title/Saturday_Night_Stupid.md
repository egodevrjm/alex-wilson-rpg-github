## Lyrics

Verse 1:
There ain't much to do when the sun goes down
In a dot on the map kinda sleepy town
So we pile in the truck with the radio loud
And we find ourselves trouble to make mama proud
Climbed the water tower with a can of spray
Left our mark where the stars ain't faint, no way
Sheriff's calling but we're long gone
Just some kids trying to have some fun

Chorus:
We're going Saturday night stupid
Doing things we probably shouldn't
But we're young and we're alive
In this small town Friday night
Got our boots and our blue jeans
Living out those teenage dreams
Yeah we're going Saturday night stupid
And we're loving every minute of it

Verse 2:
Took the courthouse steps like a photo shoot
Posting pictures in our cowboy boots
Mama's texting asking where we are
While we're dancing on the hood of daddy's car
Tailgate down at the old quarry
Telling lies about our glory
We ain't got much but we got right now
And that's enough somehow

Chorus:
We're going Saturday night stupid
Doing things we probably shouldn't
But we're young and we're alive
In this small town Friday night
Got our boots and our blue jeans
Living out those teenage dreams
Yeah we're going Saturday night stupid
And we're loving every minute of it

Bridge:
Someday we'll be all grown up
With our coffee in a coffee cup
But tonight we're seventeen
Living wild and running free
Underneath these country stars
We'll chase away these battle scars

Final Chorus (Key change to A):
We're going Saturday night stupid
Doing things we probably shouldn't
But we're young and we're alive
In this small town Friday night
Got our boots and our blue jeans
Living out those teenage dreams
Yeah we're going Saturday night stupid
And we're loving every minute of it
Every single minute of it
Oh-oh-oh, every minute of it

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard country band setup: electric guitars (one with a clean tone for rhythm, one with a slightly overdriven tone for lead), acoustic guitar (for rhythm and added texture), bass guitar (driving the groove), drums (straightforward rock beat with some country-style fills), and optional steel guitar or fiddle for added country flavor. Consider adding gang vocals on the choruses to amplify the party atmosphere.

Tempo: Medium-fast tempo (around 130 bpm) to create a sense of energy and excitement. The song should feel upbeat and driving.

Key: Original key is G Major, moving to A Major for the final chorus.

Structure: Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Final Chorus, Outro (repeat last line of chorus and fade).

Performance Notes: Encourage the singer to embrace the youthful energy and deliver the lyrics with a sense of fun and enthusiasm. The band should lock in on the groove and create a powerful, driving sound. The key change in the final chorus should be emphasized with a slight increase in intensity. Consider adding a guitar solo after the second chorus to showcase the musicianship of the band. Ending with the singer echoing 'Oh-oh-oh, every minute of it' before a fade out.
