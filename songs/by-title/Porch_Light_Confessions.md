## Description
"Porch Light Confessions" is a deeply personal and relatable country-folk ballad about confronting family history and finding the first glimmers of healing. Set against the backdrop of a late-night porch in rural America, the song captures the vulnerability and honesty that emerge in quiet, contemplative moments. Alex Wilson's emotive vocals, combined with gentle acoustic instrumentation, create an intimate atmosphere that invites listeners to reflect on their own journeys toward forgiveness and self-acceptance. The song explores themes of strained father-son relationships, the weight of unspoken words, and the challenging path to understanding and releasing past hurts.

## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Sitting on this creaky swing at half past two
Mama's kitchen light's the only thing that's true
Got a mason jar of something strong beside me
And a heart full of words I can't set free
The crickets and the katydids keep time
While I practice how to say what's on my mind

Chorus:
Underneath these porch light confessions
Where the darkness meets the glow
All my secrets and my questions
Find a place they're safe to go
Every shadow tells a story
Every truth I've never told
In these porch light confessions
Where my weary soul unfolds

Verse 2:
There's a letter in my pocket from last spring
Words from daddy that still make my conscience sting
Says he's sorry for the belt and all the fear
But some apologies take years and years to hear
I can see him in the driveway, hat in hand
Wondering if his boy will ever understand

Chorus:
Underneath these porch light confessions
Where the darkness meets the glow
All my secrets and my questions
Find a place they're safe to go
Every shadow tells a story
Every truth I've never told
In these porch light confessions
Where my weary soul unfolds

Bridge:
Maybe forgiveness ain't about forgetting
Maybe it's just learning how to breathe
In the space between the hurt and the letting
Go of who I swore I'd never be
And maybe time won't heal all wounds, that's true
But it can teach you how to live with the scars, anew

Chorus:
Underneath these porch light confessions
Where the darkness meets the glow
All my secrets and my questions
Find a place they're safe to go
Every shadow tells a story
Every truth I've found the strength to hold
In these porch light confessions
Where my healing soul unfolds

Outro:
Sitting on this creaky swing at half past three
Mama's kitchen light still shining down on me
Just shining down on me, yeah, setting my soul free

## Performance Notes

"Porch Light Confessions" should be performed with a raw, vulnerable vocal delivery, emphasizing the emotional honesty of the lyrics. Instrumentation should include acoustic guitar (fingerpicked or gently strummed), upright bass (playing simple, supportive lines), and possibly a subtle pedal steel guitar for added atmosphere. Consider adding light percussion like a shaker or brushes on a snare drum to enhance the gentle, late-night feel. The key is G major, lending itself to open chords and a natural vocal range. The tempo is slow and deliberate, allowing the lyrics to breathe and resonate with the listener. A simple, repeating guitar riff throughout the verses can create a sense of hypnotic contemplation. The bridge allows for a slight build in intensity, perhaps with the addition of a subtle string arrangement or a more pronounced guitar strumming pattern before returning to the quieter, more introspective final chorus. Aim for a sound that evokes artists like Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Lori McKenna. The outro vocals could feature a slight echo or reverb to enhance the feeling of solitude and reflection.
