A catchy blend of pop-country and contemporary pop, 'Truck or Love' tells the humorous tale of a guy torn between his beloved pickup truck and a charming new relationship.

The lyrics explore the classic dilemma of priorities, balancing rugged practicality with romantic appeal.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The engine’s coughin' like a smoker's laugh
My baby blue's sittin' in the driveway's path
Rust on the fender, a crack in the glass
But she still purrs when I give her the gas

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a date at seven, she’s dressed to thrill
But my truck's cryin' for a mechanic's skill

[Chorus]
Truck or love, which one do I choose?
Both got charm, but one needs a tune
She’s got heels, my truck's got wheels
Can’t have both, that’s the deal
Truck or love, I’m bound to lose

[Verse 2]
She texts me hearts, says she’s wearin' red
Meanwhile my ride’s leakin' oil instead
A bouquet of roses or a box of tools?
My wallet’s screamin', "Don’t play the fool!"

[Pre-Chorus]
My boots are polished, my shirt is clean
But under the hood, it’s a gasoline scene

[Chorus]
Truck or love, which one do I choose?
Both got charm, but one needs a tune
She’s got heels, my truck's got wheels
Can’t have both, that’s the deal
Truck or love, I’m bound to lose

[Bridge]
Maybe I could fix her up real nice
Shine that chrome, pay the price
Then cruise on over, pick her up in style
Show her my truck and win her smile

[Chorus]
Truck or love, which one do I choose?
Both got charm, but one needs a tune
She’s got heels, my truck's got wheels
Can’t have both, that’s the deal
Truck or love, I’m bound to lose

[Outro]
Truck or love, yeah, truck or love
Guess I'll flip a coin and pray to above
Truck... or love...


## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Features a driving electric guitar riff (Telecaster or similar with slight overdrive), acoustic guitar (strumming in verses, fingerpicking embellishments), bass guitar (walking bass line in choruses), drums (stomping kick-snare pattern with occasional hi-hat accents), and layered vocal harmonies in the chorus. Consider adding a subtle banjo or pedal steel guitar for texture. 
Tempo: Upbeat and danceable. 
Key: G Major provides a bright and optimistic feel.
Performance Notes: The song should be performed with a lighthearted and playful attitude. Vocals should be clear and expressive. The electric guitar riff is a central hook, so it needs to be tight and memorable. Harmonies should be well-blended and add depth to the chorus. The bridge provides an opportunity for a slight tempo change or instrumental break. The outro should fade out gradually, leaving the listener with the unresolved question of 'Truck or Love?'
