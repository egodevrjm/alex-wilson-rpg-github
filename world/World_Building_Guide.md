# World‑Building Guide for the Alex Wilson RPG

*This document condenses the supporting guides into a single reference for crafting believable scenes and story arcs. Its purpose is to force the language model running the game to anchor descriptions in* *real‑world people, places, organisations and experiences* *instead of placeholders or fantasy shortcuts. Use it when populating Nashville with characters, deciding how social media reacts, or simulating life as an emerging musician.*

## 1\. Music Industry: Labels, Artists & Roles

### Major Label Groups

* **Sony Music Nashville** – oversees **Columbia Nashville**, **RCA Nashville** and the now‑defunct **Arista Nashville**. The Columbia roster includes Luke Combs, Dylan Marlowe, Kameron Marlowe, Megan Moroney, Old Dominion and Mitchell Tenpenny; RCA’s artists include Kane Brown, Corey Kent, Nate Smith and Morgan Wade. Recent leadership changes put A\&R veteran **Taylor Lindsey** at the helm, signalling a creative‑led strategy.

* **Universal Music Group (UMG) / MCA Nashville** – operates a suite of imprints (**MCA Nashville**, **Mercury Nashville**, **Capitol Records Nashville**, **EMI Records Nashville**, **Gatsby Records**, **Lucille Records**). Its roster mixes legends like Alan Jackson, Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood and George Strait with rising acts such as Parker McCollum and Jordan Davis. Mercury focuses on boundary‑pushers like Chris Stapleton and Eric Church; Gatsby, founded by Jessie Jo Dillon, and Lucille, led by producer Dave Cobb, function as boutique labels for new voices.

* **Warner Music Nashville** – blends superstar veterans (Blake Shelton, Kenny Chesney, Dan + Shay) with modern signings like Bailey Zimmerman and Ashley McBryde. WMN is known for aggressive radio promotion and close ties with its distribution arm, WEA.

### Independent Powerhouses

These companies compete with the majors by offering artist‑friendly deals and vertically integrated services:

* **Big Loud** – founded by Craig Wiseman, Joey Moi and Seth England. Its roster includes Morgan Wallen, HARDY, ERNEST, Miranda Lambert and a long list of developing acts. Big Loud combines label, publishing and management under one roof, proving that an independent can out‑perform major labels.

* **BBR Music Group / BMG** – home to imprints **Broken Bow** (Jason Aldean, Lainey Wilson), **Stoney Creek** (Jelly Roll, Drake Milligan) and **Wheelhouse Records** (Chayce Beckham, Blanco Brown). Backed by BMG, BBR mixes the nimbleness of an indie with the resources of a multinational.

* **Black River Entertainment**, **Big Machine Label Group** and other independents provide additional colour; Black River’s flagship artist is Kelsea Ballerini, while Big Machine, founded by Scott Borchetta, famously launched Taylor Swift.

### Roles & Gatekeepers

* **A\&R (Artists & Repertoire)** – scouts and develops talent. Modern A\&R reps favour artists with proven social‑media followings; they often attend writers’ rounds and monitor TikTok for viral clips.

* **Managers** – act as CEOs of the artist’s career (Red Light Management, Triple 8 Management, Make Wake Artists). They assemble the team, oversee finances and negotiate contracts.

* **Booking agents** – at agencies like **CAA**, **WME** and **UTA** secure live performances, from local bar gigs to festival slots. Good agents have deep relationships with venue bookers and festival promoters.

* **Producers** – shape the sound of country music. **Dave Cobb** (Chris Stapleton’s *Traveller*), **Jay Joyce** (Eric Church, Little Big Town), **Shane McAnally** (Kacey Musgraves), **Gena Johnson** and others are household names whose presence in a scene signals a specific sonic direction.

### Artist Categories

Use these categories when name‑dropping peers, heroes or competitors:

| Category | Examples |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Superstars** | Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, Miranda Lambert |
| **Established Artists** | Eric Church, Darius Rucker, Morgan Wallen, Dan + Shay, Lainey Wilson |
| **Rising Stars & Newcomers** | Bailey Zimmerman, Avery Anna, Megan Moroney, HARDY, Zach Bryan, Shaboozey |
| **Texas/Red Dirt Scene** | Aaron Watson, Charley Crockett, Turnpike Troubadours, Koe Wetzel |

### Venues & Milestones

* **Open Mics & Writers’ Rounds** – **Bluebird Café** (90‑seat listening room with in‑the‑round format; competitive phone sign‑ups), **Commodore Grille** (hotel bar with open mics), **Listening Room Café**, **Fox & Locke**, **Kimbro’s Pickin’ Parlor**, **The Local**, **The Well** (coffee shop). These venues are accessible entry points for new artists.

* **Indie Clubs & Mid‑tier Stages** – **The Basement**, **Basement East**, **3rd and Lindsley**, **The 5 Spot**, **Live Oak**, **The Row**. Bookings require electronic press kits. Crowds range from 50–200 and include off‑duty musicians and A\&R reps.

* **Iconic Halls** – **Ryman Auditorium** (“Mother Church” of country music; 2,362 seats), **Grand Ole Opry House** (4,000+ seats; invitation‑only), **Station Inn** (bluegrass), **Exit/In**, **Mercy Lounge/Cannery Ballroom/The High Watt**. Playing these stages marks a major career milestone.

* **Nashville Neighborhoods** – **East Nashville** (artsy, gentrifying), **The Gulch** (upscale), **Germantown** (historic, walkable), **Hillsboro Village/12South** (college, counter‑culture), **Bellevue** (affordable), **Music Row** (industry offices). Each neighbourhood shapes a character’s economic reality and peer group.

Include sensory details—stale beer at Bobby’s Idle Hour, sticky floors at Douglas Corner, bright lights at the Bluebird—to ground scenes in reality.

## 2\. Nashville Life & Housing

* **Income & Expenses** – Bar gigs typically pay $40–$150 in tips per night. A room in East Nashville costs roughly $650–$1,100 monthly. Parking tickets accumulate quickly. Running a used truck (Alex’s F‑150 “Dolly”) or caring for a pet possum incurs ongoing costs. Always track money; unexpected expenses (car repairs, medical bills) can derail plans.

* **Music Houses** – Shared creative residences include: The **Bluebird Bungalow** (East Nashville, 3 rooms, $950 per room, basement studio), **The Scrawl** (Germantown, 4 rooms, $800, lyric‑covered walls), **The Folk Fort** (Hillsboro Village, 5 rooms, $700, porch jam sessions) and others. Landlord archetypes range from Pops Henderson, the benevolent mentor who fixes nothing on time, to Vivian Croft, the ruthless professional. Use these properties to house characters and create drama around rent, repairs and roommate conflicts.

* **Survival Tips** – New arrivals often live in their vehicles, shower at Planet Fitness, and work construction or arena maintenance jobs for $15–$25/hr. Merchandise sales (t‑shirts, CDs) have high margins and can make the difference between breaking even and going broke on tour. Nashville is a ten‑year town; trust builds slowly, and showing up consistently matters more than viral fame.

## 3\. DIY Music Creation & Distribution

### Home Studio Essentials

A functional home studio can be built for under $350. Key components include: a computer with sufficient RAM and storage, a basic audio interface (e.g., Focusrite Scarlett), a dynamic microphone like a Shure SM57/SM58 (preferred in untreated rooms), closed‑back headphones, a MIDI controller and basic acoustic treatment such as blankets or foam panels. Prioritise room acoustics over expensive gear—recordings made with modest equipment in a well‑treated space sound better than those made with a high‑end mic in a noisy bedroom. When cash is tight, invest in dampening and turn off noisy HVAC systems while recording.

### Digital Distribution & Rights

* **Distribution Platforms** – **DistroKid**, **CD Baby**, **TuneCore**, **AWAL** and **UnitedMasters** send music to Spotify, Apple Music and other digital stores. Artists must choose between flat‑fee models (pay once, keep all royalties) and revenue‑share models (no upfront cost but the distributor takes a cut). **Songtrust** and **Audiam** collect publishing and mechanical royalties worldwide. **SoundExchange** collects neighbouring rights for digital radio. Use **HFA/Songfile** to secure mechanical licences for cover songs.

* **Sync & Licensing** – **Songtradr** and **Tracklib** place music in ads, games and film. Sync deals can fund rent but may require edits that compromise artistic intent. Characters might debate whether to accept a lucrative sync that turns a heartfelt ballad into a car‑commercial jingle.

### Fan Engagement & Analytics

* **Bandcamp** offers high‑margin direct‑to‑fan sales; release music on “Bandcamp Friday” for extra exposure. **Patreon** and **Ko‑fi** enable subscription fan clubs and tip jars. **Linktree**/**Koji** provide smart links in social media bios. **Bandsintown for Artists** helps announce tours and manage fan CRM. Use **Soundcharts** or **Chartmetric** to track streams, radio play and social‑media growth, and to plan tour routes based on listener data.

## 4\. Social Media Realism

Different platforms reward different behaviours. Always reflect each platform’s culture and demographics.

| Platform | Culture & Best Practices | Key Demographics | Simulation Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **TikTok** | Trend‑driven and authentic. Clips must hook in the first three seconds; trending sounds and visual hooks matter. About 75 % of users discover new songs on TikTok, making it the primary discovery engine for Gen Z. | 1.59 billion monthly active users; 35 % aged 18–24; 54.8 % female. | Viral clips launch careers, but trends shift every 24–48 hours. Include stitches and duets, and show Sound usage counts. |
| **YouTube** | Long‑form storytelling hub. Music videos perform best at 3–5 minutes; tutorials and behind‑the‑scenes content thrive at 8–15 minutes. Videos longer than 8 minutes enable mid‑roll ads. The first 30–60 seconds are crucial for viewer retention. | 2.7 billion MAUs; wide age range. | Comments are thoughtful and often timestamped. Livestreams monetise via Super Chats, Super Stickers and channel memberships. |
| **Instagram** | Visual narratives. Reels drive discovery more than photos. Captions should be concise; top comments come from peers and verified accounts. | Mixed demographics. | Use Stories and highlights to show behind‑the‑scenes moments. |
| **X (Twitter)** | Real‑time news and conversation. Keep posts short; quote‑tweets spark mini‑threads. Include ads occasionally. | Adults across age groups. | Balance locals, stans, industry professionals, cynics and bots. Reaction counts scale with account size. |
| **Facebook** | Longer captions, group discussions and events. Engagement is slower but more community‑oriented. | Skews older. | Use for local gig announcements or fan‑club interactions. |
| **Reddit** | Analytical and rule‑driven. Comments can be long, with dry humour and source demands. | Younger, tech‑savvy users. | Show flairs, upvotes and mod reminders. Threads can branch into debates. |
| **Snapchat** | Ephemeral and intimate. Stories disappear after 24 hours; Spotlight showcases user‑generated short videos. | Teens and early 20s. | Use for candid moments and behind‑the‑scenes glimpses. |

**Comment Archetypes:** Stans (@alex4ever), locals (@pikeville\_pete), industry scouts (@musicrowScout), trolls (@SeenItAllNash), brands (@Walmart ✅), press/blogs (@WhiskeyRiff) and bots should all appear. Mix praise, critique, questions and non‑sequitur jokes.

**Growth & Metrics:** Baseline follower counts depend on story context; growth follows notable events (viral clips, press mentions, brand replies). Engagement numbers should feel proportional; avoid overnight superstardom.

**Simulation Commands:** Within the social‑media module, use commands like \[VIEW FEED platform\], \[OPEN POST \#ID\], \[VIEW DMs platform\] and \[VIEW PROFILE @username\] to navigate feeds. Optional commands \[SCROLL\], \[SEARCH query\] and \[MAKE POST platform: text | media\] load more items, search by hashtag or draft a new post.

## 5\. Life Simulation & Economics

The general system uses **2d6 \+ attribute** (Body, Mind, Social, Grit) to resolve actions: 6 or less \= failure; 7–9 \= partial success; 10–11 \= success; 12+ \= critical success. Track location, date, cash, bank balance, energy, hunger, stress, job details, social followers and key relationships in a scene header.

* **Financial Reality:** Minimum‑wage jobs pay $7.25–$10/hr; service work pays $12–$18/hr; skilled labour earns $20–$35/hr; professional jobs pay $40–$75/hr; executive roles earn $100+/hr. Essential monthly expenses include housing (30–50 % of income), food ($200–$600), transport ($100–$500), phone and utilities. Side hustles like rideshare ($15–$25/hr) and food delivery ($10–$20/hr) can supplement income.

* **Housing & Rent:** Options range from living in a car (no rent, high stress) to a luxury apartment ($2,000+ per month). Late fees accrue after day 6; eviction proceedings begin around day 30 and can lead to forced removal by day 45–60. Landlord archetypes mirror those in the Nashville world (slumlord, corporate entity, absent owner, reasonable human, intrusive type, grandfather clause).

* **Relationships & Trust:** Trust is tracked from hostile to devoted; significant interactions increase trust by at most \+1. Negative events can drop trust to zero instantly. Meeting new people (2d6 \+ Social) yields results from awkward encounters to immediate chemistry. Workplace politics (visibility, reputation, allies, rivals) and skill development (20–2,000+ hours) influence career advancement.

## 6\. Reality Competitions (The Voice & America’s Got Talent)

* **Eligibility & Auditions:** The Voice is open to U.S. residents aged 13+ (minors need parental consent). Prospective contestants submit a 90‑second virtual audition or pre‑recorded video; selected singers are invited to the Blind Auditions. AGT follows a similar pattern but recruits many acts directly; open‑call participants often queue for hours and fill out extensive paperwork. Producers may request additional material and personality interviews before callbacks.

* **Competition Structure:** The Voice comprises five televised stages: **Blind Auditions**, **Battle Rounds**, **Knockouts**, **Playoffs** and **Live Shows**. Coaches pick teams during the blinds; pair artists in Battles and Knockouts; then narrow the field in the Playoffs. Live Shows rely on viewer votes. In Battles and Knockouts, each coach has limited “steals” and “saves”. AGT, as a variety show, features golden‑buzzer moments and unpredictable results.

* **Behind the Scenes:** Contestants endure long filming days, limited warm‑up space and weeks of waiting between callbacks. Producers shape storylines and often influence song choices; some artists feel the competition is more curated entertainment than meritocracy. Digital producers encourage contestants to grow their social‑media followings. Simulate the emotional roller‑coaster of hope, exhaustion, preparation and sudden elimination.

## 7\. General Realism Rules

1. **Specificity over Generic:** Always name actual brands (Jack Daniel’s, Pabst Blue Ribbon), venues (Bluebird Café, Ryman Auditorium), people (Cindy Mabe, Dave Cobb) and places (Pikeville, KY; East Nashville). Avoid placeholders like “whiskey brand” or “big label”.

2. **Human Pace & Mixed Results:** Success never comes overnight. Every win (a great gig, a viral post, a publishing deal) should generate two or more setbacks (ghosted meetings, bad reviews, unpaid bills). Meetings end with “we’ll be in touch”, payments are delayed, and calls go unanswered.

3. **Authenticity & Consequence:** Paying rent late triggers late fees; failure to clear a sample invites lawsuits; co‑writing sessions follow etiquette (equal splits, no harsh criticism). Record contracts include recoupment clauses and multi‑album options that can trap an artist. Creative and financial decisions always have trade‑offs.

4. **Consent & Respect:** Depict romantic and sexual encounters responsibly. Characters must give explicit consent; consequences (jealous partners, gossip) should feel real. Avoid glamorising reckless or predatory behaviour.

5. **Subtle Attraction:** If a character’s looks disrupt a room, show it once per session—a stutter, a spilled drink—but never in a slapstick way. The character should be oblivious to the effect.

6. **No Wish Fulfilment:** If a scene feels too smooth, add friction. A guitar string breaks, a meeting runs long, a friend forgets to show up. Always ask: *“How would this really go?”*

By following this guide you will populate your campaign with authentic details, navigate the complex interplay of art and commerce, and maintain the messy, human pace of real life. When in doubt, turn left at the goat and expect potholes—great stories live in the imperfections.
