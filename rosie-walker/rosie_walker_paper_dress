    "title": "The Fortunate Sons",
    "description": "A minor-key, slow-burn country lament (4/4, ~76 BPM) led by finger-picked acoustic guitar and a low, pulsing floor tom. Mournful fiddle answers the vocal; a restrained electric guitar uses tremolo swells instead of flashy runs. Subtle organ pad fills the corners; brushed snare blooms into a half-time lift in the last chorus. Natural tape warmth; arrangement stays intimate to let the lyric carry the protest.",
    "story": "Billy Ray Caulfield. That’s the name that started this song. He was two years behind me in school, quarterbacked the Pikeville Panthers, and had a smile that could charm a snake out of its skin. He didn’t want to go. Nobody did. But his daddy was a miner and his granddaddy was a miner, and boys like Billy Ray don’t get deferments. They get dog tags. I was at the Opry, all decked out in Nudie’s rhinestones, singing about some made-up heartbreak, when I heard he’d been killed outside of Da Nang. I went back to the hotel, took off the glitter, and this song bled out of me. This town wants me to sing about cheatin’ hearts. But there’s a bigger, colder kind of cheating going on, and it’s breaking the only hearts that ever mattered to me.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe letter came on Monday, smudged with the postman’s hands\n“Greetings from the President,” a thunder cross the land\nMy cousin drew a number, the banker’s boy drew none\nDaddy says a fountain pen can weigh more than a gun\nThere’s a flag in every window down on Music Row tonight\nBut they don’t send their own to sing about the fight\n\n[Chorus]\nI won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum\nOr sweeten up a bitter war with a radio hum\nI’ll say a prayer for the mothers and the folded-up flags they become\nBut I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey said, “Girl, keep your mouth shut, let the brass bands play\nThere’s a handsome check to cash if you just smile and look away”\nBut the boys from off the ridge got mud caked on their names\nWhile the sons in the big townhouses hold up spotless hands\nIf the truth is bad for business, then my business here is done\nI’ll sing for all the scared ones bleeding in the sun\n\n[Chorus]\nI won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum\nOr sweeten up a bitter war with a radio hum\nI’ll say a prayer for the mothers and the folded-up flags they become\nBut I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons\n\n[Bridge]\nSpin that radio dial and try to cut my lines\nTurn me down and sell your soap between the warning signs\nA whisper through the static still outruns your dollar signs\n'Cause truth don’t need permission when it’s running out of time\n\n[Final Chorus]\nI won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum\nOr write pretty lilies on a telegram for someone else's son\nI’ll sing for all the dog-tag ghosts and the ones that had to run\nBut I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons"

    "title": "Atkins Can Kiss My Ass",
    "description": "Rowdy honky-tonk shuffle (~152 BPM) with twangy electric riffs, clanking bar-room piano, and tic-tac bass locking to a train-beat snare. Fiddle saws playful answers in the turnarounds; a slap-back on the vocal adds bite. The band drops to just kick, bass, and acoustic under the bridge before a floor-stomping final chorus.",
    "story": "Had the big meeting with Mr. Guitar himself today. He sat behind that giant desk, didn’t look up for a full minute. Then he takes off his glasses and says, ‘Rosie, the numbers on the last record were… gentle. We need you to be more… palatable.’ He slid a stack of songs across the desk. Terrible, syrupy things about daisies and holding hands. He said I needed to stop wearing the black jeans, cut the ‘sullen’ act, and be the nice girl he knows I can be. I just looked at him. At his perfect suit and his perfect hair. And I thought about every compromise, every time I bit my tongue, every time I smiled when I wanted to scream. I stood up, pushed his awful songs back into his lap, and said, ‘Chet, you can take your palatability and shove it.’ I didn't write this song. I just reported the facts.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe said, “Darlin’, hush that gravel, we’ll drown it out in strings\nPowder up your cheekbones, we’ll sell ‘em pretty things”\nI said, “Honey, keep your violins the hell out of my song\nIf you wanted lace and curtains, you hired somebody wrong”\n\n[Chorus]\nAtkins can kiss my ass\nI ain’t your looking glass\nTurn the steel guitar up hot, let the kick drum crash\nIf the truth sounds like it’s trouble, then go on and buy more glass\nWrite it on a bar-nap, frame it up in brass:\nAtkins can kiss my ass\n\n[Verse 2]\n“Smile more for the cameras, be the girl that they adore”\nI smiled right when I meant it, then I walked right off the floor\nKeep your hair dye and your diet and your sequined, velvet leash\nMy dusty boots ring truer than your perfectly polished speech\n\n[Chorus]\nAtkins can kiss my ass\nI ain’t your looking glass\nTurn the steel guitar up hot, let the kick drum crash\nIf the truth sounds like it’s trouble, then go on and buy more glass\nWrite it on a bar-nap, frame it up in brass:\nAtkins can kiss my ass\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can stack a hundred fiddles, you can hire a choir of ten\nBut a lie still sounds like a lie again and again\nI’m gonna sing it how I live it—smoky, loud, and fast\nPut that in your ledger, boy, and kiss my entire ass\n\n[Final Chorus]\nAtkins can kiss my ass\nPrint it big, sweetheart, and bill me for it last"

    "title": "Whiskey’s Just a Chorus",
    "description": "A slow, brutally honest country-blues in 4/4 at 60 BPM. Sparse instrumentation: George’s sunburst acoustic, a sad, slow, walking upright bass, and Rosie’s bitter vocal. No pedal steel, no strings—just the raw sound of two instruments and a voice. It’s a song about rejecting the beautiful lie of the tragic drunk man.",
    "story": "I am the one who is supposed to be the outlaw, the mess. But he's the one who writes the script for his own tragedy every night. He sings about the whiskey being the devil, but he drinks it like a muse. They call him a genius, a beautiful broken man. I call him a selfish baby who found a way to make his vice into an art form. My albums are full of songs about how his sorrow is beautiful. It’s not. It’s boring and it’s loud, and it's the only story he knows how to tell. I will not be the sad, silent woman watching him be great anymore. The tragedy is that it’s all a performance.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou pour another bourbon and the sad strings start to play\nYou're drowning every promise in the sorrow of the day\nThey call it your dark demon, but it makes you look like a saint\nA genius with a problem that the good Lord's just acquainted\nYou sing about the heartbreak like it’s news you just found out\nBut you’re the one who wrote the ending when you poured the bottle out\n\n[Chorus]\nBut whiskey’s just a chorus when you’re standing on a stage\nIt’s the beautiful confession that gets printed on the page\nYou don't want a savior, you don’t want a single cure\nYou just need an audience to know your pain is pure\nWell, I've heard every verse of that tired, cheatin' song\nAnd I'm leaving you to sing it to yourself from now on\n\n[Verse 2]\nI’m tired of the drama and the curtains and the cues\nThe velvet-lined destruction that you dress up in the blues\nI’m tired of the applause for every time you fall apart\nLike being this disaster is your only kind of art\nYou’re the king of broken heartstrings and the master of the tear\nAnd I'm the one who's tasked with holding all your secrets and your fear\n\n[Chorus]\nBut whiskey’s just a chorus when you’re standing on a stage\nIt’s the beautiful confession that gets printed on the page\nYou don't want a savior, you don’t want a single cure\nYou just need an audience to know your pain is pure\nWell, I've heard every verse of that tired, cheatin' song\nAnd I'm leaving you to sing it to yourself from now on\n\n[Outro]\nI won't be your co-star anymore\nI won't be your excuse"

    "title": "Nashville Babylon",
    "description": "A slow, menacing, country-noir ballad at 65 BPM. The song slinks in on an upright bassline that walks through the verses like a private eye in a smoky bar. A tremolo-soaked electric guitar answers Rosie’s vocal lines with mournful, weeping phrases. The drums are barely there—just a whispered hi-hat and a ghostly cross-stick on the snare. Rosie’s vocal is a conspiratorial, bitter whisper, recorded dry and close to the mic, making every cynical observation feel like a shared, dangerous secret.",
    "story": "It’s all fake. The whole damn town. I saw one of my heroes, a man who sings gospel on Sundays, passed out drunk with a girl half his age in his Lincoln Continental. I saw a ‘happily married’ duet act throwing glasses at each other backstage before they went out and sang about forever. They sell ‘three chords and the truth,’ but the truth is the one thing you can’t have. It’s a city built on beautiful lies. They’ll take your pain, shine it up, put it on a record, and leave you with the bill for the rhinestones. I used to think this was Jerusalem. Turns out it’s Babylon. And the writing is on the wall.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe Saint of the Grand Ole Opry, with his Bible and his tie\nKeeps a bottle full of secrets in his boot heel on the sly\nHe sings about redemption with a teardrop in his eye\nThen meets a different angel when the sun has left the sky\nAnd the Queen of the Airwaves, with her voice of pure spun gold\nSings of a forever love, but her own is bought and sold\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to Nashville Babylon, where all the saints are rust\nWhere they build you up with promises, then bury you in dust\nThey'll take your soul just for a souvenir, your pain for a number one\nAnd smile right in your pretty face until the dirty deed is done\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe biggest man at the record label, he's a deacon at his church\nLeft a girl from Chattanooga crying in the lurch\nShe was singing for a contract, he was looking for a thrill\nNow she's just another ghost stranded at the foot of Music Hill\nShe's waitressing on Broadway, humming what might have been\nAnd he's at some fancy dinner, committing one more sin\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to Nashville Babylon, where all the saints are rust\nWhere they build you up with promises, then bury you in dust\nThey'll take your soul just for a souvenir, your pain for a number one\nAnd smile right in your pretty face until the dirty deed is done\n\n[Bridge]\nThey call me the wild one, the sinner, and the shame\n'Cause I refused to play their dirty little star-making game\nBut I've seen the righteous crumble, and I've watched the faithful fall\nThe biggest joke in this whole town is I'm the worst of them all\nI'd rather be a sinner who is honest in her rage\nThan a smiling hypocrite they've locked inside a golden cage\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, welcome to Babylon\nDon't let the rhinestones fool you\nOn your way down"

    "title": "The Prettiest Cage",
    "description": "A mid-tempo country-rock anthem of defiance at 120 BPM. This track has a stronger pulse than her earlier work, with a powerful, steady drum beat and a driving bassline that feels like a heart gathering courage. Twangy Telecaster guitars trade licks with a Hammond B3 organ, giving it a sound that bridges classic country with a tougher, blues-rock edge. Rosie's vocal is the centerpiece—not bitter, but soaring and determined. It's the sound of a decision being made in real-time.",
    "story": "They gave me a brand new Cadillac last week. Pearl white. A ‘bonus’ for the last album going gold. I drove it out to Percy Priest Lake, parked, and just stared at the water. I thought about the first guitar I ever had, a beat-up Sears Silvertone my uncle gave me. I thought about how a new set of strings felt like the greatest luxury in the world. Now I have a car I’m scared to scratch and a closet full of rhinestone jackets I don’t even like. They give you just enough pretty things to make you forget you’re trapped. They praise your fire, then hand you a golden fire extinguisher. This isn't a life. It's a residency. A beautiful, comfortable, soul-crushing residency in the prettiest cage they could build. The bonus isn't the car. It's the realization that I can just leave the keys in it and walk away.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey built this cage for me with bars of solid gold\nGave me a velvet swing and a story to be told\nDressed me up in diamonds, put a guitar in my hand\nSaid, “Sing for us, little bird, you're the finest in the land”\nThey painted a horizon on the wall behind my perch\nSo I could sing of freedom and never leave their church\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey told me what to sing and they told me what to wear\n“Now don't get too political, don't show ‘em that you care\nJust smile for all the cameras, girl, and hide your tangled wires\nAnd we'll feed you fame and fortune to fuel your pretty fires”\nThey loved the songs of heartbreak, they loved the songs of pain\nSo long as I remembered that I’d never name the names\n\n[Chorus]\nBut the door was never locked, I just never thought to try\nWas so mesmerized by the glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly\nThis ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take\nThis bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake\n'Cause a cage is still a cage, no matter how pretty it's made\n\n[Bridge]\nThey love a broken woman, they can sell her tragedy\nBut a woman who knows her own mind is their worst catastrophe\nThey can keep the golden bars and their high-society rage\n'Cause a free bird in the mountains beats a queen inside the prettiest cage\nYeah, a free bird in the mountains is turnin' her own page\n\n[Final Chorus]\nOh, the door was never locked, I just never dared to try\nWas so mesmerized by the glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly\nThis ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take\nThis bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake\nYeah, this bird is breaking out of the prettiest cage"

    "title": "Rhinestone Judas",
    "description": "A classic, slow-burning country heartbreak waltz in 3/4 time at 68 BPM. The track is drenched in sorrow, led by a weeping pedal steel guitar and a sparse, mournful piano that plays teardrop-like notes. A brushed snare and a quiet upright bass keep the waltz time. Rosie's vocal is weary and wounded, recorded with a touch of natural echo as if sung in a vast, empty hall. It cracks with raw emotion on the high notes, a masterful performance of betrayal.",
    "story": "Her name was Peggy. She came to town the same time I did, with a guitar case just as battered and eyes just as wide. We were roommates, sisters-in-arms. I got signed first, and I pulled her up with me. Got her a job singing backup, lent her money, gave her my songs when she was short on material. I told her everything. Told her about George, about the baby, about how I felt like I was suffocating. Last week, an executive at the label ‘suggested’ I take some time off for my ‘health.’ He knew things, intimate things, that only one person could have told him. Then I hear Peggy’s been given a solo spot on the big New Year’s Eve show. My spot. It wasn’t a knife in the back. It was a sequined glove, patting my shoulder as it pushed me off the ledge.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou borrowed my lipstick, you borrowed my car\nYou were right there beside me in every cheap bar\nWe were soldiers of fortune in this neon-lit war\nSwore we'd have each other's backs, and so much more\nI told you my secrets, the dark and the deep\nThe promises I made that I couldn't keep\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou smiled at my parties and you drank all my wine\nSaid, “Rosie, I'll have your back, sister, any old time”\nBut when the rumors were flying and my name turned to mud\nYou were the one holding the shovel and spilling the blood\nYou just nodded and listened with a sad, tender grace\nWhile you were out there rehearsing to take over my place\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls\nBut you were just the cleverest of the ambitious girls\nI should've seen the hunger hiding deep within your eyes\nBeneath the hollow laughter and the gossamer lies\nYou kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me for a song\nMy Rhinestone Judas, I should've known it all along\n\n[Bridge]\nI hope you get that record deal, I hope you get the fame\nI hope every time you hear my music, you burn with the shame\n'Cause you can't build a mansion on a foundation of sin\nAnd the ghost of my trust is a guest you'll be letting in\nFor thirty silver dollars, or a spot up on the stage\nYou helped me write the final words on this old gilded cage\n\n[Final Chorus]\nYes, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls\nAnd you were just the prettiest of the ambitious girls\nI saw it in the shadows lurking there behind your eyes\nBeneath the careful sympathy and well-rehearsed goodbyes\nYou kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me out for a song\nMy Rhinestone Judas… God forgive me, I knew it all along"

    "description": "A gritty, mid-tempo bar-room banger at 130 BPM with a dominant, driving piano and aggressive electric guitar fills. The rhythm section is loud and unpolished, mimicking the sound of a live band in a smoky joint. The vocal is a sneer, a direct confrontation with the music she is tired of singing and hearing.",
    "story": "I walked into a dive last night. Saw a woman sitting alone, crying into a flat beer. What was playing? My own damn song, 'Broken Bottle Blues.' I was selling her misery back to her, and making a fortune off of it. They love a song that wallows, a song that gives you permission to be pathetic. They want me to write another one. But my pain is my own now, not a three-minute track for a nickel. I'm done being a jukebox for other people's cheap sorrows.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey drop a quarter in the slot and the needle finds the groove\nThey want a little wallow, a soundtrack for a move\nTo a payphone or a highway, a whiskey and a plea\nTo hear a voice of sorrow that sounds an awful lot like me\nThey want the tear-stained melody, the sad, poetic lie\nThat says it's somehow beautiful to break right down and cry\n\n[Chorus]\nThe jukebox ain't my confessor, the barstool ain't my pew\nI'm done with selling sad songs to a crowd that just wants two\nMore verses of the tragedy, the hook that keeps them numb\nThis three-chord therapy for hire is finally overcome\nI'm taking back the copyright on every single pain\nI'm done with being your jukebox in this Nashville pouring rain\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe radio's full of women with a quiver in their throat\nSingin' 'bout a dress they bought, a letter that he wrote\nAll of them are angels who were only slightly soiled\nTheir sadness neatly packaged up, perfectly unspoiled\nBut my kind of heartbreak is a hole and not a crack\nAnd I'm not putting that darkness on another vinyl track\n\n[Chorus]\nThe jukebox ain't my confessor, the barstool ain't my pew\nI'm done with selling sad songs to a crowd that just wants two\nMore verses of the tragedy, the hook that keeps them numb\nThis three-chord therapy for hire is finally overcome\nI'm taking back the copyright on every single pain\nI'm done with being your jukebox in this Nashville pouring rain\n\n[Bridge]\nYou want a tear?

Fiddle and electric guitar trade call-and-response fills; a gang-vocal “NO!” punctuates the chorus. Short solo break leads into a breakdown bridge with just claps, bass, and voice. Theme/Overview: A boundary-setting anthem—catcalls, gatekeepers, and grabby hands meet a two-letter gospel. File beside tough-minded, witty barnburners that turn a catchphrase into a chorus you can stomp to.",

This is the rawest recording in the collection, featuring just Rosie and her acoustic guitar, recorded so closely you can hear the soft whisper of her fingers on the frets and the quiet intake of her breath. Her vocal is not a performance; it's a soft, loving murmur, full of the hope and fierce protectiveness of a mother-to-be. It’s a secret shared between two heartbeats.",
    "story": "His father is a legend, but he’s also a storm. A beautiful, brilliant storm that I can’t live in anymore, and I won’t raise a child in its path. This song isn’t for RCA.

The track opens with a lonely piano, soon joined by swelling orchestral strings and a heart-wrenching pedal steel. Rosie's voice is at its most powerful and polished, a knowing nod to the Nashville production she is rejecting. It’s a performance filled with love, profound pity, and the cold, hard pain of a necessary amputation.",
    "story": "He’s a king. The king of heartbreak, the king of a sad country song. But his kingdom is made of glass, and he’s always the one holding the hammer. I love him. God help me, I will always love him. But you can’t save a man from his own throne. I wrote this while he slept. It's the last song I'll ever write about him. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to a clean goodbye.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou wear a crown of neon, you hold a scepter of regret\nYou're the undisputed sovereign of the ones we can't forget\nYour kingdom is a barstool, your castle's built on shame\nAnd every heart you conquer only learns to curse your name\nYou rule a million jukeboxes, a million lonely nights\nBeneath the pale and buzzing glow of cheap motel room lights\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou sang a song for me once, with a voice so pure and true\nFor a moment, I saw the angel that was buried deep in you\nYou built a world in three short minutes, a world I'd die to own\nThen you smashed it all to pieces and left me there alone\nThat's your most tragic talent, the one that sets you high apart\nYou know just how to build a world before you break a heart\n\n[Chorus]\nSo hail to the King of Broken Things, the lord of the last call\nThe poet of the pieces after the great fall\nI loved you more than reason, but less than my own life\nAnd I can't be another jewel in the crown of your lonely strife\nYour throne is built on sorrow, your anthem is the blues\nAnd being just your empress is a role I must refuse\n\n[Bridge]\nThey'll say I was the wild one who couldn't be controlled\nBut the truth is, I was sober enough to watch a story getting old\nYou can't build a home inside a hurricane's eye\nAnd this was my one moment to say a real goodbye\nBefore your beautiful destruction became my very own\n\n[Final Chorus]\nSo long live the King of Broken Things, in his castle made of pain\nThe poet of the whiskey tears and the lonely, midnight rain\nI loved you more than my own soul, but less than the one I saved\nAnd I can't be another headstone on the path your sorrow paved\nLong live the king...\nThe lonely, lonely King of Broken Things"

The track is built on the foundation of an open-tuned acoustic guitar, creating a droning, almost mystical rhythm. A low, mournful cello provides the bass notes, moving slowly beneath the guitar. There are no drums. Rosie’s vocal is chant-like and powerful, less a melody and more an incantation. It connects her personal story of escape to a much older, deeper story of survival and identity rooted in her Cherokee heritage.",
    "story": "Chet once told me to ‘smile more’ because my cheekbones were a ‘great asset.’ Said my grandmother must have been a real beauty. He had no idea. My grandma was a Hatfield, but her mama was Cherokee. She taught me things the Bible never did. About listening to the land. About how some rivers hold the memories of everyone who ever drank from them. Nashville tried to make me into a simple, digestible product. A ‘Country Rose.’ They celebrated the part of me that was white and pretty, and they told me to hide the rest. But the rest is the strongest part. It’s the part that knows how to survive. This isn’t just me leaving Nashville. It’s the river of my ancestors finally washing me clean and carrying me home.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe man from the record label, he looked upon my face\nSaid, “Those cheekbones are an asset, but we really must erase\nAny hint of the wildwood, the dark river's shore\nWe're selling a sweet country rose, nothing less, nothing more”\nHe gave me new boots and a name that felt wrong\nAnd told me to hide my grandmother's tongue in my songs\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut he don't know my grandma, with her hair so long and black\nWho walked a trail of sorrow and she never once looked back\nShe taught me that a silence can be a warrior's shield\nAnd a woman's truest strength is in the truth she will not yield\nShe said, “This world will try to name you, to claim you as its own\nBut you listen for the water, child, and you'll never be alone”\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins\nIt sings of survival through the droughts and through the rains\nIt's older than Nashville, it's stronger than fame\nAnd it's whisperin' to me now, “Go remember your name”\nIt's callin' me homeward, away from this place\nWith the mud of the mountain still fresh on its face\n\n[Bridge]\nThey took away our land, they took our tongue, they tried to take our soul\nBut you can't kill a spirit that you never can control\nAnd every time I sing a song of leaving and of loss\nI'm singin' for the ancestors who had to pay the cost\nThis ain't no song of heartbreak, this is paying of a debt\nTo the women who kept walking, so that I would not forget\n\n[Final Chorus]\nThere's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins\nIt sings of survival through the droughts and through the rains\nIt's older than Nashville, it's stronger than fame\nAnd it's whisperin' to me now, “Go remember your name”\nIt's callin' me homeward, away from this place\nWith the mud of the mountain still fresh on its face"

    "title": "This Holler Holds My Name",
    "description": "A gentle, deeply nostalgic folk tune at 90 BPM. A quiet rejection of everything Nashville stood for, built around a simple, clean finger-picked acoustic guitar and Rosie's unadorned vocal. The feel is intimate and resolute, like a personal declaration whispered to the mountains themselves.",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey gave me a new name, they gave me a new town\nPut my face on a record that spun 'round and 'round\nThey called me the “Bad Girl,” the “Wild Child,” the “Queen”\nBut that ain't the woman I was ever meant to have been\nShe's a stranger in the mirror, she's a well-rehearsed part\nWith a rhinestone-covered surface where she used to have a heart\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Cause my soul ain't made of neon, my heart don't beat in time\nWith the rhythm of the deal-makers on the Music Row line\nMy blood runs thick with coal dust, my spirit's with the pine\nAnd the face in all the magazines was never truly mine\nIt was just a photograph of someone I agreed to be for pay\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree\nThe one my mama gave to me, the one that sets me free\nThe Cumberland River knows it, the mountain mist and rain\nI'm goin' back to the only truth that washes off the pain\nRosie Walker's famous, but Rose Marie is home\n\n[Bridge]\nLet 'em wonder what happened to the girl with the green eyes\nLet 'em write their cautionary tales all filled with rumor and with lies\nI'll be on a front porch swing, where the evening crickets drone\nLearning how to be myself again, and finally not alone\nWith the ghosts of all the women who knew this ground I'm on\n\n[Final Chorus]\nYeah, this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree\nThe one my daddy gave to me, the one that sets me free\nThe Cumberland River knows it, the mountains know my name\nI'm goin' back to the only love that burns a steady flame\nRosie Walker's fading, but Rose Marie is home"

    "title": "Burn the Paper Dress",
    "description": "A sparse and percussive acoustic track at 110 BPM. The driving rhythm comes from Rosie's own hand hitting the body of her Martin guitar, creating a raw, determined heartbeat. Her acoustic guitar plays a simple, repeating riff in a minor key. There are no other instruments except for her voice, which is layered in a simple, self-made harmony on the chorus. It’s not a song of anger, but of ritual and cleansing.",
    "story": "I was playing a part, wearing a costume made of paper. It was never real. I took a match and lit the corner of one of the photos. Then I tossed it on the pile. There’s no going back when the bridges are ash.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe woman in the magazines, she's got my eyes, my mouth\nShe's smiling for the camera as her career is headin' south\nThey put her in a paper dress, a crown of paper lies\nAnd told her she was queen of all the things that she despised\nShe sold her pain for pennies, she sold her ghost for gold\nAnd she did every single thing the men in power told\n\n[Verse 2]\nTonight I read her letters, the ones from girls back home\nWho said her voice had saved them from feelin' all alone\nAnd for a single second, a sadness cut me through\nFor killing off the only saint they ever thought they knew\nBut that saint was just a story, a well-constructed myth\nAnd I can't live inside a cage of someone else's wish\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame\nEvery single article that ever wrote her name\nI'm pilin' up the evidence of a life that wasn't mine\nAnd offerin' the whole damn thing up to the turpentine\nLet the fire take the fake girl, let the smoke forget the rest\nTonight I burn the paper doll, tonight I burn the dress\n\n[Bridge]\nThey'll say I lost my mind, or I ran off with a man\nThey'll never understand it was the only sane plan\nYou can't just walk away from a ghost that wears your face\nYou have to perform an exorcism to leave the haunted place\n\n[Final Chorus]\nSo I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame\nEvery single article that ever wrote her name\nI'm pilin' up the evidence of a life that wasn't mine\nAnd offerin' the whole damn thing up to the turpentine\nLet the fire take the fake girl, let the smoke forget the rest\nTonight I burn the paper doll, tonight I burn the dress"

    "title": "The Ghost in the Radio",
    "description": "A haunting, ethereal ballad at a slow 70 BPM. The sound is drenched in the echo and reverb of a classic 1960s recording, but the instrumentation is minimal: a lonely, tremolo-heavy electric guitar plays a simple arpeggio, while a brushed snare and a stand-up bass keep a quiet, swaying rhythm. Rosie’s vocal is distant and soft, as if she’s already broadcasting from somewhere far away. It is her final reflection on the persona she is about to abandon.",
    "story": "I’m leaving, but she has to stay. I’m setting her free to be a ghost, a story. From tomorrow on, she’s not my problem. She’s just a voice in the air.",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe neon sign is humming a sad and lonely tune\nReflected in a puddle beneath a cloudy moon\nThe man behind the counter is listenin' to my song\nAbout a girl who got it right by gettin' everything wrong\nHe's tappin' out the rhythm, he doesn't look at me\nHe doesn't see the person that I no longer want to be\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat girl, she's full of whiskey, she's full of cheap regret\nShe's a three-minute distraction from a life you ain't lived yet\nShe'll sing you through the night shift, she'll get you through the drive\nShe'll make you feel for just a spell, a little more alive\nShe's everything they made her, she's brave and she's a mess\nAnd I'm the only one who knows the truth of her loneliness\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd soon that's all I'll be, a memory in a wire\nA disembodied voice that's for public rent and hire\nSingin' 'bout a heartbreak from a million miles away\nFrom the woman I'll be living as, starting from today\nLet her sing forever, let her tear her heart in two\nThe ghost in the radio has nothing more to do with you\n\n[Bridge]\nShe'll always be nineteen, with a fire in her eyes\nShe'll never have to compromise, she'll never have to tell no lies\nShe's frozen in the amber of a three-chord tragedy\nAnd the greatest gift I give to her is finally setting her free\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, the bus is pulling out now, leaving her behind\nA story on the airwaves, a comfort for the kind\nWho need to hear a sad song...\nFrom the ghost in the radio"

    "title": "First Day of My Life",
    "description": "A simple, unadorned folk hymn. The only sound is Rosie’s voice and her acoustic guitar, playing a straightforward chord progression reminiscent of a Carter Family song. Her vocal is quiet, clear, and utterly devoid of Nashville artifice. It’s not sad, it’s not angry; it’s calm and full of a quiet, dawning hope. This is the last song in the notebook, the sound of a woman taking her first breath of free air.",

Pedal steel sighs gently; mournful fiddle shadows vocals from verse two. Sparse piano colors key lines, while light harmonies lift choruses. Intimate, woody, natural sound. The final word on the whole affair. A summation. The note I should have left on the nightstand.",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNew Year’s Eve, the Opry lights, a sea of rhinestone shine\nA camera like a moonbeam on a midnight tide\nShe changed a single lyric, bowed to no one’s throne\nAnd whispered to the mic, “Bad girls leave town—but smart girls go home”\nA Greyhound bus coughed smoke out like a sinner’s prayer\nA ticket in her boot heel, red dust in her hair\nA suitcase and a notebook and a round-shouldered guitar’s moan\nAnd a tiny hidden heartbeat… smart girls go home\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was a barroom hymn who wore a neon crown\nHis voice could hush a fistfight in any jukebox town\nHis hands they shook like autumn leaves when the bottle got too loud\nBut a gentle kind of thunder when the stage met the crowd\nHe pressed that sunburst soundboard right into her palms\nSaid, “Play it mean, play it honest, and play it past the applause”\nShe kissed his trembling knuckles, left the roses by the phone\nLeft the ringing of his sorrow… smart girls go home\n\n[Chorus]\nRun, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you\nTwo heartbeats in the darkness, and one you’re tryin' to find, too\nThere’s a future in the holler where the lonesome coal trains moan\nWhere a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone\nLet the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone\nYou’re runnin’ toward a better life… smart girls go home\n\n[Verse 3]\nDecember snow was falling on the Cumberland pines\nShe was counting down the mile markers like they were rosary lines\nThe city kept on calling with a pleading preacher’s tone\n“Come on back, be forgiven,” but the price was her own soul\nSo she held her stomach gently like a secret, holy flame\nAnd promised the new life inside a different kind of name\nIn a window’s ghost she saw a mother she had never known\nAnd in the glass, a singer, who was finally not alone\n\n[Chorus]\nRun, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you\nTwo heartbeats in the darkness, and one you’re tryin' to find, too\nThere’s a future in the holler where the lonesome coal trains moan\nWhere a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone\nLet the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone\nYou’re runnin’ toward a better life… smart girls go home\n\n[Bridge]\nSomeday a boy will wonder why his voice feels like a storm\nWhy a sad song fits his chest just like a jacket keeps you warm\nHe’ll hold that sunburst, chipped and worn, and not quite know from whom\nOnly feel the way a lonesome note can open up a room\nAnd she’ll be on a porch swing where the mountain shadows roam\nSmiling at the secret that carried them both home\n\n[Final Chorus]\nRun, Rosie, run, let the tired past turn to smoke\nLet the gossip drown in whiskey, let the promises stay broke\nThere’s a cradle in the cabin and a name you’ll call your own\nThere’s a heartbeat like a sparrow sayin’, “Mama, take me home”\nLeave the neon to the lonely and the crown to some other throne\nYou saved a life by leavin’... smart girls go home\n\n[Tag]\nBad girls go to Nashville…\nBut the bravest girls go home"
