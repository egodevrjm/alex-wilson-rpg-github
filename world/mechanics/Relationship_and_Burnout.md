| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Wary | Default | — | — |
| Open | 1 positive scene | Single +1 assist | Broken minor promise |
| Invested | 3 positives | Contact/resource share | Public slight |
| Committed | 5 positives + milestone | Advantage on deals | Major breach |
| Devoted | Narrative milestone | Emergency bailout | Betrayal resets to Wary |

## 2. Interaction Framework
2d6 + Social (+1 if tailored). 6− refusal (trust -1 possible) / 7–9 conditional + Favour Debt / 10–11 yes / 12+ enthusiastic + trust +1.

## 3. Fatigue & Burnout

## 5. Favour Debt
