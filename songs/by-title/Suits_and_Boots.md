## Description
A high-energy country-rock shuffle that pits authenticity against corporate ambition. Driven by a twangy Telecaster, a stomping kick-snare groove, and punctuated by bright fiddle fills, the song builds to a raucous chorus perfect for a barroom singalong. The bridge offers a brief respite with banjo and upright bass before exploding into a crowd-pleasing full-band finale, brimming with rootsy swagger and blue-collar pride. The song explores the tension between artistic integrity and the allure of commercial success, championing the heart of a song over the pursuit of fame and fortune.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Three phone calls ‘fore I finished my beer,
Talkin’ percentages I don’t wanna hear.
Y’all wearin’ ties while I’m scuffin’ these toes,
Singin’ my truth down a gravel road.

[Pre-Chorus]
They’re pushin’ papers, I’m pushin’ songs,
They got a clock, but I’ve got all night long.

[Chorus]
It’s suits and boots, boardroom versus barn,
I don’t need no contract to strum this guitar.
You chase the numbers, I’ll chase the truth,
Worlds apart but we’re sharin’ the roof.
Yeah, they got the ink, I got the roots—
It’s a battle of the suits and boots.

[Verse 2]
They promise me spotlights, tour bus dreams,
While I’m patchin’ my jeans with duct-tape seams.
They’re talkin’ charts, I’m talkin’ dirt,
They sellin’ brands, I’m singin’ hurt.

[Pre-Chorus]
They got the money, I got the crowd,
One sings quiet, the other sings loud.

[Chorus]
It’s suits and boots, boardroom versus barn,
I don’t need no contract to strum this guitar.
You chase the numbers, I’ll chase the truth,
Worlds apart but we’re sharin’ the roof.
Yeah, they got the ink, I got the roots—
It’s a battle of the suits and boots.

[Bridge]
One’s ridin’ elevators, one’s ridin’ dirt roads,
One counts the profit, one counts the banjo.
But maybe somewhere, there’s a deal in between,
Where the heart of a song meets a big-city dream.

[Guitar Solo]

[Final Chorus]
It’s suits and boots, both playin’ their part,
But I’ll keep my name where I keep my heart.
They chase the fame, I chase the proof,
Can’t buy the soul of a mountain truth.
Yeah, I ain’t for sale, I’m standin’ loose—
Still stompin’ proud in these boots…
While they’re polishin’ suits.

[Outro]
So pour me a coffee, y’all sip your wine,
I’ll keep writin’ songs on my own damn time.
Yeah, I'll keep writin' songs, keep speakin' my mind,
One song at a time.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard country-rock setup: electric guitar (Telecaster with twangy tone), acoustic guitar (Martin D-28 style), bass guitar (upright preferred for the bridge section, otherwise electric), drums (kick, snare, hi-hat, occasional toms), fiddle (prominent fills and solos), banjo (featured in the bridge), and backing vocals (gang vocals in the chorus). Guitar solo section added after the Bridge.
Tempo: 112 BPM (Country Rock Shuffle Feel)
Key: G Major
Structure: Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus-Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus-Bridge-Guitar Solo-Final Chorus-Outro
Performance Notes: The song should be performed with a raw, energetic feel. Vocals should be slightly gritty and passionate. The fiddle and Telecaster should have plenty of twang. The chorus harmonies should be loud and enthusiastic. The bridge should be a dynamic shift down in energy and instrumentation, building back up to the final chorus. Encourage audience participation during the chorus.
