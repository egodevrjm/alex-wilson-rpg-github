## Director Tips

**For Routine Gigs:**
```
SCENE: Alex plays a Tuesday night at Robert's, thin crowd, just another shift
TEMPO: Keep it moving, don't belabor the ordinary
```

**For Important Gigs:**
```
SCENE: Alex plays Friday at Layla's, A&R rep is supposedly there
FOCUS: on the stakes and Alex's awareness of being watched
TEMPO: Real-time, moment by moment
```

**For Chaos:**
```
SCENE: Alex's set at Honky Tonk Central on a packed Saturday
TONE: Chaos but grounded - real rowdy crowd energy
```

**For Character Study:**
```
SCENE: Alex plays Wednesday open mic at a small venue
FOCUS: on why Alex does this, what it means to him
TEMPO: Slow, reflective
```

## Remember

Broadway gigs are Alex's bread and butter—they're survival, not glory. Most are forgettable. Some matter. The Director chooses which kind this is.

Not every gig needs to be special. Sometimes it's just work. Sometimes it's where magic happens. Sometimes it's where everything goes wrong.

The power is in the specificity: which venue, what time, who's there, what Alex is bringing to it emotionally.
