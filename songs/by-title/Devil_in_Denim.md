## Description
A raw, outlaw-country breakup anthem delivered with a Kentucky drawl. "Devil in Denim" tells the story of a charming but ultimately worthless ex. Alex Wilson's gritty vocals are backed by a mid-tempo arrangement blending bluesy acoustic riffs, searing pedal steel, mournful fiddle, and punchy drums. Sharp, storytelling verses build into defiant pre-choruses, culminating in explosive choruses featuring gang vocals and a memorable hook. The bridge offers a moment of introspective release before surging back into the final chorus. The song's mood is sassy, empowering, and scornful, evoking the atmosphere of dusty bars and the spirit of heartbreak recovery. It fades out with a bluesy guitar riff and defiant hums, leaving the listener with a sense of hard-won independence.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Gritty acoustic guitar riff with a slow, bluesy twang in E, building to a mid-tempo pop-country beat)

(Verse 1)
You rolled into my life with a wink and a grin,
Tight blue jeans, thought I’d let you in.
Promised me the stars, swore you’d never stray,
But your sweet talk was just dust blowin’ my way.
Left me with a bar tab and a heart full of cracks,
Now I’m pickin’ up pieces, and I ain’t lookin’ back.

(Pre-Chorus)
You played the part, but your mask wore thin,
Ain’t no savin’ a soul that’s rotten within.

(Chorus - Catchy, fiery hook with soaring vocals and fiddle stabs)
You’re a devil in denim, but you ain’t worth a dime,
Stole my heart, left me hurtin’ for the very last time.
All flash, no cash, just a snake in disguise,
Devil in denim, I see through your lies.
Yeah, you burned me good, but I’m risin’ again,
This cowboy’s movin’ on, sayin’ amen to the end.
Devil in denim, you ain’t worth a dime!

(Verse 2)
Thought you were my whiskey, smooth and so fine,
But you were cheap rotgut, spillin’ over the line.
Your charm was a con, your love just a game,
Now the jukebox is mockin’ me, playin’ your name.
I’m done with your swagger, your boots full of dirt,
Tossin’ your memory where it don’t hurt.

(Pre-Chorus)
Your sweet lies faded like a barroom light,
I’m leavin’ you behind in the Kentucky night.

(Chorus - Building with full band, punchy energy)
You’re a devil in denim, but you ain’t worth a dime,
Stole my heart, left me hurtin’ for the very last time.
All flash, no cash, just a snake in disguise,
Devil in denim, I see through your lies.
Yeah, you burned me good, but I’m risin’ again,
This cowboy’s movin’ on, sayin’ amen to the end.
Devil in denim, you ain’t worth a dime!

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic and light drums, then surges. Pedal steel swells gently)
I should’ve seen the warning in your crooked smile,
But I danced with the devil for a little while.
Now I’m takin’ my heart, leavin’ you in the dust,
This song’s my goodbye, and it’s justice I trust.
And I ain't gonna cry, no I ain't gonna rust.

(Chorus - Massive, crowd-ready finale with gang vocals)
You’re a devil in denim, but you ain’t worth a dime,
Stole my heart, left me hurtin’ for the very last time.
All flash, no cash, just a snake in disguise,
Devil in denim, I see through your lies.
Yeah, you burned me good, but I’m risin’ again,
This cowboy’s movin’ on, sayin’ amen to the end.
Devil in denim, you ain’t worth a dime!

(Outro - Fades with bluesy guitar riff and a defiant hum)
Devil in denim… not worth a dime.
Adios, darlin’… I’m doin’ just fine.
Yeah, I'm doin' just fine...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (rhythm and bluesy lead riffs), electric guitar (light tremolo on bridge, power chords on chorus), pedal steel guitar (fills and sustained notes), fiddle (accents and solo fills), bass guitar (walking basslines), drums (snare on 2 & 4, kick on 1 & 3, some light brush work on the verses), gang vocals (chorus).

Tempo: Aim for a steady, driving feel. Slight push and pull in the tempo can add to the emotional impact.

Key: E (This makes the bluesy guitar riffs and pedal steel licks easier to execute).

Vocals: Emphasize the Kentucky drawl and deliver the lyrics with conviction and sass. The pre-chorus needs to build tension leading into the explosive chorus.

Mix: The mix should be raw and authentic, emphasizing the twang of the guitars and the grit of the vocals. Avoid excessive polish.

Gang Vocals: Harmony should be raw and simple, emphasizing the 'outlaw' feel.

Bridge: Pedal steel swells should be subtle at first, adding to the emotional build. Drums should be minimalist and sparse for the first two lines then build in energy for the last two lines.
Fiddle solo should be 2-4 bars long and between the second chorus and the bridge, fast-paced, and twangy
