## Description
A high-energy, tongue-in-cheek Christmas anthem blending pop, country, and trap elements. "Christmas at Grandma's" paints a chaotic yet loving picture of a family holiday gathering. Think sleigh bells meet 808s, acoustic guitar jams with a trap beat, and grandma spiking the eggnog. The song features modern pop vocals with harmonies, gang vocals for hype, talk-box guitar melodies, and even pitched possum sounds for quirky texture. A guaranteed earworm for anyone who's ever experienced a slightly dysfunctional, utterly memorable family Christmas.

## Lyrics

Intro:
(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na)

Verse 1:
Deck the halls with drama, fa-la-la-la-la
Grandma spiked the eggnog with bourbon from her bra
Tree's held up with duct tape, ornaments are broke
Half the family's divorced but everybody's here (hey!)
And there's something in the ceiling going scratch-scratch-scratch
Pretty sure that's a possum but we're not gonna ask

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause when you're this messed up
You gotta laugh it off
When you're this messed up
You know that love's enough

Chorus:
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Where the crazy comes alive
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Thank God we all survived
We got a possum in the attic
Whiskey in the pie
But somehow it's magic
Every single time
It's Christmas at Grandma's
(Na na na na na na na)
Christmas at Grandma's
(Na na na na na na na)

Verse 2:
Photo by the fireplace, everybody "cheese!"
Someone's ex just showed up, someone's calling the police
Presents from the dollar store wrapped in last year's bags
Grandma's got her teeth out singing Cardi B (okurrr!)
That possum's getting bold now, he's eyeing up the ham
Welcome to our Christmas, Instagram can't understand

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause when you're this messed up
You gotta laugh it off
When you're this messed up
You know that love's enough

Chorus:
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Where the crazy comes alive
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Thank God we all survived
We got a possum in the attic
Whiskey in the pie
But somehow it's magic
Every single time
It's Christmas at Grandma's
(Na na na na na na na)
Christmas at Grandma's
(Na na na na na na na)

Bridge:
O come all ye ratchet
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye
To Grandma's house
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
We're broke but we're golden
Divorced but we're chosen
O come let us annoy them
O come let us destroy them
O come let us enjoy this
Christmas at Grandma's!

Final Chorus:
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Where the crazy comes alive
It's Christmas (Christmas!)
At Grandma's (Grandma's!)
Thank God we all survived
We got a possum in the attic
Whiskey in the pie
But somehow it's magic
Every single time
It's Christmas at Grandma's!

Outro:
(Na na na na na na na) - Possum in the house!
(Na na na na na na na) - Whiskey in the house!
(Na na na na na na na) - Grandma's in the house!
(Na na na na na na na) - Christmas!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Sleigh bells, trap hi-hats, acoustic guitar, banjo, 808 bass, bass guitar, Trap-patterned Christmas bells, vocal chops, pitched possum sounds, talk-box electric guitar, hand claps, stomps. Vocal arrangement features lead vocals, harmonies, doubles, and gang vocals. The tempo is upbeat and energetic. The mood is chaotic, humorous, and ultimately heartwarming. Pay close attention to the transitions into the choruses, building anticipation with the pre-chorus. The talk-box guitar 'na na na' parts should be rhythmically tight and expressive. The possum sounds should be subtle but noticeable, adding to the song's quirky character. Consider adding a short instrumental break after the second chorus with a prominent banjo solo layered with the trap beat.
