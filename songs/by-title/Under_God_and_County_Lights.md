A heartfelt country anthem celebrating the enduring spirit of small-town America, 'Under God and County Lights' evokes the nostalgia of Friday night football games, community pride, and the values instilled under the watchful gaze of both faith and tradition. Featuring warm acoustic guitar, a steady, driving drum beat, and the mournful cry of pedal steel, interwoven with spirited fiddle runs and twangy Telecaster licks, the song builds from intimate verses to soaring, anthemic choruses, capturing the essence of youthful dreams and lifelong bonds forged under the Friday night lights.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Warm acoustic guitar strums, steady kick drum, and a soulful fiddle, evoking a small-town field at dusk)

(Verse 1)
Sun’s fadin’ fast ‘cross a stranger’s sky, far from where I’m tied,
It’s the Fourth of July, but my heart’s back where the hometown pride resides.
Ain’t the flags or the sparklers I’m missin’ here tonight,
It’s the cool fall air, the crowd’s wild roar, under those small-town lights.
I smell the fresh-mowed grass, hear the band’s marchin’ call,
See old-timers at the diner, tradin’ tales ‘bout the games last fall.
Talkin’ ‘bout the season, ‘bout the kids, like they do every year,
My soul’s pullin’ me back to the moments I hold dear.

(Pre-Chorus)
Pickup trucks pack the lot, dust kickin’ up with pride,
The whole town’s out, standin’ tall on the home team’s side.
Worn bleachers creak, all set for the fight,
As the sun steps back and surrenders to the night.

(Chorus - Big, soaring, anthem-like)
God and county lights, burnin’ up the night,
We stood for the flag, said a prayer, and cheered the fight.
That hundred yards was our world, our sacred ground,
Our dreams alive in the echo of that hometown sound.
Young and free, chasin’ what we dreamed we’d be,
Small-town kids with a big-time legacy.
We learned to live, to love, to stand for what’s right,
Under God and county lights.

(Verse 2)
Cheerleader smiled as queen, her crown lit up the crowd,
Coach was like a father, tough but fair, and always proud.
“Play for the front,” he’d say, “not the name on your back,”
We left it all on that field, through glory and the lack.
Farmers, shopkeepers, shoutin’ as one,
Bound by heart and hustle ‘til the game was done.

(Chorus - Full band, powerful)
God and county lights, burnin’ up the night,
We stood for the flag, said a prayer, and cheered the fight.
That hundred yards was our world, our sacred ground,
Our dreams alive in the echo of that hometown sound.
Young and free, chasin’ what we dreamed we’d be,
Small-town kids with a big-time legacy.
We learned to live, to love, to stand for what’s right,
Under God and county lights.

(Bridge - Music pulls back, soft guitar and pedal steel)
Some things stick like dust on a well-worn cap,
Not the score, but the lessons that keep callin’ back.
How to stand, how to fall, how to hold your own,
That’s the heart of livin’ where the roots have grown.
Yeah, that's the heart of living, where roots have grown

(Instrumental Break - Twangy Telecaster solo, soulful pedal steel, and a fiery fiddle run, carrying the spirit of small-town nights)

(Chorus - Massive, crowd-ready, heartfelt)
God and county lights, burnin’ up the night,
We stood for the flag, said a prayer, and cheered the fight.
That hundred yards was our world, our sacred ground,
Our dreams alive in the echo of that hometown sound.
Young and free, chasin’ what we dreamed we’d be,
Small-town kids with a big-time legacy.
We learned to live, to love, to stand for what’s right,
Under God and county lights.

(Outro - Fades with soft acoustic, lonesome fiddle, and gentle steel)
Yeah, I’m far from home, ‘neath a stranger’s glow,
But my heart’s still beatin’ where those memories grow.
Standin’ proud there...
Under God and county lights.
Forever home there...
Under God and county lights.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (Martin D-28 or similar), electric guitar (Telecaster with a twangy tone), pedal steel guitar (tuned to E9th), fiddle (acoustic violin), bass guitar (electric), drums (standard kit with emphasis on the kick and snare).
Tempo: Moderate, around 88 BPM. Should feel steady and driving, but not rushed.
Key: G Major. Lends itself to the open chords and bright sound.
Arrangement: Intro builds gradually. Verse 1 features mostly acoustic instruments. The pre-chorus adds more drive from the bass and drums. The chorus is full band, with harmonies on the vocals. The bridge strips back the instrumentation to create a moment of reflection. The instrumental break allows each instrument to shine.
Mixing: Focus on a clean and balanced mix. The vocals should be clear and upfront. The fiddle, pedal steel, and Telecaster should have distinct spaces in the mix. The drums should provide a solid foundation without overpowering the other instruments. Consider adding subtle reverb to create a sense of space, especially on the pedal steel and fiddle.
Performance Notes: The vocalist should convey sincerity and heartfelt emotion. The fiddle and pedal steel players should be expressive and soulful. The drummer should maintain a steady and consistent groove. The guitar player should use tasteful licks and fills that complement the melody. Pay attention to dynamics and build throughout the song. The chorus should be the most powerful and impactful section.
Consider adding a backing vocal harmony on the final chorus for added depth and grandeur.
