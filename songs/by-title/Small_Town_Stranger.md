## Lyrics

Dropped in the city like a summer storm,
Neon signs flashin', far from my norm.
Thousand kids, brand-new faces,
Heart's racin', don't know my places.

Locker room talkin', big game day,
Pretty girl smilin', what do I say?
Tryin' to fit in, but it's hard to do,
When you're just a country heart passin' through.

(Chorus)
I'm just a small-town stranger,
In this city full of lights,
Tryna find my rhythm,
Under these Hollywood nights.
Everybody's talkin', but nobody knows,
The small-town stranger, wherever he goes.

Coach says, "Son, we need your height," 
But my dreams are playin' music every night.
These city streets, so bright and wide,
But I miss that dirt road midnight ride.

Skyscrapers glow, like stars so bright,
But can't replace the front porch nights.
I’m searchin' for signs, to guide me through,
Just a Kentucky boy with somethin' to prove.

(Chorus)
I'm just a small-town stranger,
In this city full of lights,
Tryna find my rhythm,
Under these Hollywood nights.
Everybody's talkin', but nobody knows,
The small-town stranger, wherever he goes.

(Bridge)
Yeah, guess every star shines when it’s out of place,
I'll find my voice, make my own space.
This city might be strange, might feel alone,
But every heart's got a way to make it home.

(Chorus)
I'm just a small-town stranger,
In this city so wide,
Gonna find my story,
Gonna let it ride.
Everybody's talkin', but nobody knows,
The small-town stranger, wherever he goes.

(Outro)
Small-town stranger, yeah, that's me,
Gonna find my way, you wait and see.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar is the foundation, layered with electric guitar (clean tone with slight reverb), a driving drum beat (kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4), and a subtle bass line emphasizing the root notes. The chorus features a light synth pad to add atmosphere. A banjo or mandolin can be added tastefully for a touch of country authenticity. Vocals should be clean and emotive, with a slight twang to maintain the country feel. Consider backing vocals for the chorus to add depth. The bridge could feature a slight tempo increase and a more prominent drum fill to build energy leading back into the final chorus. Dynamics are important: keep the verses more intimate and build to a powerful chorus. Key is well suited for male tenor range.
