| Context | Sensory Snippet |
| :---- | :---- |
| LA late session | Thin neon spill through half‑drawn blinds; stale yerba mate can on interface |
| NYC subway post‑gig | Warm gust of brake dust + sax busker long‑tone smear |
| London drizzle load‑out | Damp gaffer tape peeling off flight case; umbrella ribs tapping snare case |
| Atlanta trap studio | Low purple LED glow; rolling chair wheels over stray MIDI cable |
| Berlin warehouse | Sub frequencies shaking loose plaster dust trails |
| Nashville bluegrass jam | Mandolin chop like a metronome; faint smell of case humidifier sponge |
| Camden alt venue | Sticky floor mosaic of cider and confetti |
| Jazz club | Glass clink syncopated with ride cymbal ping |
