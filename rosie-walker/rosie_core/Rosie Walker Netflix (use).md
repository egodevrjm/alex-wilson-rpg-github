---

**00:00:00 — COLD OPEN (ARCHIVAL / AUDIO)**

BLACK.

A faint hiss. House mics crackle. Then a woman’s voice—steady, dangerous.

**ROSIE WALKER (archival, Opry):** “Bad girls go to Nashville, but smart girls go home.”

SMASH CUT TO: Audience gasp. A steel guitar whine. Tape wow.

**TITLE CARD (over black):** A Netflix Documentary FINDING ROSIE

**MUSIC CUE (instrumental):** A spare, reverent waltz motif, evoking “Baptized in Bourbon” (no lyrics).

---

**00:01:22 — OPENING MONTAGE (ARCHIVAL \+ GRAPHICS)**

B-ROLL: — 1960s Nashville marquees; RCA studio exterior; Opry crowd spilling onto Broadway. — Newspaper clippings: “WILD CHILD SHAKES OPRY,” “WALKER’S DEBUT BANNED,” “DIAMOND ALBUM FOR BAD GIRL.” (graphic animations)

**LOWER-THIRD (super):** Rosie Walker (Born Rose Marie Hatfield), 1945–?

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “In a decade of rhinestones and radio kings, Rose Marie Hatfield—the world knew her as Rosie Walker—burned hotter than anybody. Back-to-back diamond albums. Pop crossover. Then, at the absolute peak of her fame, she was gone.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote, archival audio under still):** **Dolly Parton (1994):** “Rosie had more talent in her pinky than most of us in our whole body. I still wonder what happened to her.”

---

**00:03:45 — ACT I: THE STAR**

**INT. ARCHIVE STAGE — DAY (INTERVIEW)**

**HISTORIAN \#1 (on camera):** “She hitchhiked to Nashville in ’62, seventeen years old with $37, sleeping in Centennial Park. A year later, she’s signed to RCA Victor.”

**CUTAWAY:** B\&W photo of a teenage Rosie with a 1959 Martin D‑28, annotated “Betty.”

**HISTORIAN \#2 (on camera):** “They tried to make her the next Patsy Cline on her debut, *Sawdust & Satin*. But her first single, ‘Whiskey Lullaby Blues,’ got banned instantly. It was too raw. Her defiance never left.”

B-ROLL: LP jackets for **Baptized in Bourbon (1968)** and **Good Girls Go to Heaven (1970)**; Billboard charts swinging up.

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “In 1968, *Baptized in Bourbon* hit \#1 on both the Country and Pop charts. Two years later, *Good Girls Go to Heaven* did it again. She was one of the biggest stars in the world.”

---

**00:08:10 — ACT I.2: THE FIGHT**

**ARCHIVAL AUDIO (muffled gala chatter):** A glass clink; then a muttered “—fuck off, Chet.” **ON-SCREEN CAPTION:** Industry Gala, 1970 (reported).

**HISTORIAN \#3 (on camera):** “She was the first woman of that era to demand a producing credit on her own albums. In that Nashville, it was unforgivable. For her, it was non-negotiable.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote):** **Willie Nelson (2001):** “We called ourselves outlaws, but Rosie was the real deal. She just vanished. Probably the smartest thing anyone ever did in this town.”

---

**00:12:55 — ACT II: THE VANISHING**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “New Year’s Eve, 1972\. She rewrites the line on live radio, walks offstage, leaves a note—‘Contract fulfilled. –R’—and on January 2nd, boards a Greyhound. No farewell tour. No interviews. Nothing.”

**INSERT:** Close-up of the dressing-room note (recreation), then a Greyhound pulling away into night.

**HISTORIAN \#1 (on camera):** “Fifty years of theories. Europe. Witness protection. A grave with no marker. None of it ever stuck.”

---

**00:16:20 — ACT III: THE MONEY**

**GRAPHIC EXPLAINER:** Contract animation shows “**10-YEAR ‘STAFF’ CONTRACT** → FLAT SALARY → LABEL OWNS: MASTERS, PUBLISHING, ANCILLARY RIGHTS.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “She was a global star on a predatory 10-year ‘staff’ contract. She was a salaried employee. The catalog thrived; the artist didn't own a single note. After a decade, she could walk away clean—with nothing owed, but also with nothing.”

---

**00:20:05 — ACT IV: THE FRAGMENT**

**EXT. LEXINGTON FLEA MARKET — DAY (RECREATED B‑ROLL)** Gloved hands flip through milk‑crate ephemera. A torn page in looping script catches light.

**ON SCREEN (transcription over paper fibers):** “*December 28, 1972 — Drove through Pikeville today. Mountains look like home somehow. Maybe because they are. Stop running, stop running. Can’t go back. Not with this secret I’m carrying…*” \[Torn\]

**NINA (Director, on camera):** “The handwriting matched Rosie’s set lists. It mentioned Pikeville. It mentioned a secret. The whispers in Nashville were always about an affair, maybe a pregnancy. We knew we had to follow it.”

---

**00:28:10 — ACT V: PAPER TRAIL**

**INT. PIKE COUNTY CLERK’S OFFICE — DAY** CAMERA: Over-the-shoulder on brittle record books.

**NINA (V.O., reading):** “Marriage certificate, **March 1973**—Homer Wilson and **Judith Wilson**.” (Beat.) “Judith.”

**GRAPHIC TIMELINE (animated):** — **Jan 1973:** Rosie Walker vanishes. — **Mar 1973:** "Judith" marries Homer Wilson. — **Sep 1973:** Birth of son, David Wilson. — **1996:** Homer dies (mine collapse). — **2003:** Alex's mother dies in childbirth. — **2017:** David dies (alcohol poisoning, black lung). — **2022:** Judith dies (lung cancer).

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “Judith Wilson. A quiet wife who became a widow, then a mother who lost her son. The records show she raised her grandson, Alex, after his mother died and his father descended into alcoholism.”

**HISTORIAN \#2 (on camera):** “If Judith was Rosie—a new name, a quick marriage, and a baby just nine months after she disappeared—that explains everything. The silence. The speed. The vanishing act.”

**ON‑SCREEN DISCLAIMER:** “Rumors of an affair with country star George Jones were an open secret in Nashville. Public records do not name a birth father for David Wilson.”

---

**00:36:00 — ACT V.1: THE LIVING ECHO**

**INT. WORKSHOP — DAY (INTERVIEW)**

**SESSION GUITARIST (on camera):** “Rosie’s tone lived in that 1959 Martin D‑28, ‘Betty.’ If Judith had that guitar in Pikeville… somebody learned on that soundboard.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** “Judith reportedly gave her grandson a guitar at age seven and taught him to play.”

**CUTAWAY:** A hands‑only shot (face out of frame) brushing along an old spruce top.

---

**00:41:25 — ACT VI: WITNESSES & CONSEQUENCES**

**INT. LIVING ROOM — DAY (INTERVIEW)**

**NEIGHBOR \#1 (on camera):** “Judith was a sweet lady. Church every Sunday. But when a Rosie Walker song came on the radio… she’d just stop. Like listening to her own ghost.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote, archival):** **George Jones (1998):** “Rosie Walker? Hell of a talent… Hell of a woman. Don’t know where she went, but I hope she found peace.”

---

**(SCENES 00:49:10 to 01:10:30 remain structurally the same, leading the crew to Murphy’s Bar based on the established paper trail.)**

---

**01:11:00 — ACT IX: ENTER ALEX**

**(The scene at Murphy’s Bar unfolds as written in the original script. The visual storytelling—Alex’s entrance, the room’s reaction, the reveal of the vintage Martin guitar—remains the most powerful way to introduce him.)**

---

**01:17:10 — ACT IX.4: INTERCUT — THE TRAIL CONVERGES**

**INT. EDIT BAY — NIGHT** On a split‑screen we line up: — Rosie’s handwritten “R” from the fragment. — The marriage record: Judith \+ Homer, **March ’73**. — Birth record: David, **September ’73**. — Obituary clippings: Homer (**1996, mine collapse**), David (**2017, alcohol poisoning**), Judith (**2022, lung cancer**). — A DMV still: Alexander Wilson, Pike County, age 22\. — A photo of Betty (Rosie’s 1959 D‑28) and a frame of Alex’s guitar at Murphy’s; side‑by‑side rosette matches.

**HISTORIAN \#3 (V.O.):** “She gave him the guitar when he was seven. The muscle memory, the tone, the blood… you’re gonna hear it.”

---

**(SCENES 01:18:50 to 01:22:40 remain structurally the same, presenting the handwriting expert and ethical disclaimers.)**

---

**01:24:30 — FINAL REVEAL**

BLACK. A long, deliberate beat. The bar’s room tone lingers in the dark.

In 1973, ROSIE WALKER became JUDITH WILSON.

Judith had one son, DAVID.

David had one son.
