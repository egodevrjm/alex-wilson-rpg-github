## Description
A wistful and romantic pop-country ballad filled with nostalgia for a fleeting summer romance. "Firefly Lights" opens with gentle acoustic guitar picking, accented by whimsical banjo plucks and subtle, longing pedal steel swells. Alex Wilson's warm and slightly melancholic male vocals lead into soaring choruses featuring layered harmonies, light but driving drums, delicate fiddle flourishes, and ethereal synth twinkles mimicking the magic of fireflies. An introspective bridge showcases the banjo's delicate beauty. The reverb-drenched mix creates a sense of humid summer air and spaciousness, culminating in an outro that fades with acoustic guitar echoes, the chirping of crickets, and the gentle murmur of a creek, capturing the bittersweet warmth and inviting listeners to relive their own cherished summer memories.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Remember that summer, the air thick and sweet,
Honeysuckle bloomin', humidity's heat.
We sat by the creek, moon shinin' so bright,
Fireflies dancin' like stars in the night.
Your hand in mine, whispers soft in the dark,
Secrets we shared, ignitin' a spark.
The world felt so right, but I knew deep inside,
Mornin' would come, and we'd say goodbye.

(Pre-Chorus)
Those lights in the sky, flickerin' wild and free,
Just like our hearts, chasin' what could be.

(Chorus)
Oh, firefly nights, glowin' in my mind,
That sultry summer love we left behind.
Dancin' in the dark, hearts beatin' fast,
A bittersweet dream that was never meant to last.
But even now, when the memories call,
I feel that warmth, through it all.
Firefly nights, you're still shinin' bright,
In my heart forever, that magical light.

(Verse 2)
The creek ran slow, reflectin' the moon's glow,
Your laughter echoin', soft and low.
We promised forever in that humid embrace,
But life had its plans, pullin' us different ways.
The scent of the rain hangin' heavy in the air,
A storm on the horizon, but we didn't care.
One firefly lingered, brave against the black,
Like our love holdin' on, never turnin' back.

(Pre-Chorus)
Those tiny lights fadin' as dawn starts to break,
But the feelin' we had, no one can take.

(Chorus)
Oh, firefly nights, glowin' in my mind,
That sultry summer love we left behind.
Dancin' in the dark, hearts beatin' fast,
A bittersweet dream that was never meant to last.
But even now, when the memories call,
I feel that warmth, through it all.
Firefly nights, you're still shinin' bright,
In my heart forever, that magical light.

(Bridge)
Years have gone by, but on quiet evenings like this,
I close my eyes, and I feel your kiss.
The fireflies remind me of what we once knew,
A love that flickered, but always rings true.
No regrets in the glow, just a sweet, tender ache,
For that night by the creek, the promises we made.

(Chorus)
Oh, firefly nights, glowin' in my mind,
That sultry summer love we left behind.
Dancin' in the dark, hearts beatin' fast,
A bittersweet dream that was never meant to last.
But even now, when the memories call,
I feel that warmth, through it all.
Firefly nights, you're still shinin' bright,
In my heart forever, that magical light.

(Outro)
Yeah, firefly nights...
Still shinin' in my heart...
Firefly nights.
