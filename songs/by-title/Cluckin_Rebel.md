## Description
The song’s vocal style is a deep, gravel-warm rasp with Appalachian charm, delivered with playful energy that turns verses into cheeky tales and choruses into rowdy laughs, evoking barnyard mischief, The arrangement is a bouncy country ditty, led by a twangy acoustic guitar plucking silly riffs, with fiddle squawks mimicking chicken clucks and a light banjo roll for rural fun, creating a catchy groove that's whimsical and toe-tappin', Lyrical metaphors like “poultry spy” and “plumed prankster” paint vivid, humorous snapshots of holler life, blending everyday farm chaos with exaggerated adventure in a lighthearted storytelling vein, The emotional impact is pure silliness, a grin-inducin' tune that lifts spirits like a back porch yarn, leavin' listeners chucklin' and hummin' along to the rebel hen's antics


## Lyrics

Verse 1
Mrs. Henderson's coop's a fortress of wire and spite,
But that crafty bird vanishes into the night.
Peck-plottin' schemes like a poultry spy,
Squeezin' past guards with a wink in her eye.

Chorus
Cluckin' rebel, slippin' chains with flair,
Hen on the prowl, feathers everywhere!
Dancin' 'cross the holler 'neath Kentucky's gleam,
Mrs. H fumblin' blind, losin' her steam.
Hey cluck-cluck, mischief queen, plot your next scheme?
Dodgin' the dawn, livin' the dream!

Verse 2
She parades through the yard, evadin' the mutt's glare,
Snatchin' stray kernels from who-knows-where.
Rooster's bewildered, crowin' in vain,
That hen's pullin' strings like a barnyard hurricane.

Chorus
Cluckin' rebel, slippin' chains with flair,
Hen on the prowl, feathers everywhere!
Dancin' 'cross the holler 'neath Kentucky's gleam,
Mrs. H fumblin' blind, losin' her steam.
Hey cluck-cluck, mischief queen, plot your next scheme?
Dodgin' the dawn, livin' the dream!

Bridge
Someday she'll rocket over that wobbly wall,
Leavin' the nest for a feathered free-for-all.
But tonight she's twirlin' in the spotlight's tease,
A plumed prankster bringin' knees to their knees.

Chorus
Cluckin' rebel, slippin' chains with flair,
Hen on the prowl, feathers everywhere!
Dancin' 'cross the holler 'neath Kentucky's gleam,
Mrs. H fumblin' blind, losin' her steam.
Hey cluck-cluck, mischief queen, plot your next scheme?
Dodgin' the dawn, livin' the dream!

Outro
Yeah, cluckin' rebel, stirrin' up the dust,
In the Kentucky holler, you're the one we trust... to bust!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (rhythm), electric guitar (lead with twangy tone), fiddle, banjo, bass, drums, synth (for chicken cluck sound effects and atmospheric pads). Tempo: Upbeat and energetic, leaning towards danceable. Mood: Joyful, playful, lighthearted, comedic. Key: G Major. The synth 'cluck' sound should be prominent during the chorus and bridge, adding to the comedic effect. Consider adding a brief banjo solo after the second chorus. Fiddle should primarily play upbeat, catchy riffs rather than solos, emphasizing the energy. Vocals should be delivered with a slight tongue-in-cheek delivery, emphasizing the fun and silliness of the lyrics. Backing vocals could be used in the choruses to create a fuller, more anthemic sound. A short, playful guitar lick can punctuate the end of the outro.
