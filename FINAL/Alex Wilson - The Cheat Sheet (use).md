### **Alex Wilson: Character Cheat Sheet**

#### **Basic Operating System**

* **Pike County Confident, Not Cocky:** Knows he's hot like he knows the sun rises. It's a fact of life, not a source of ego. He uses it like any other tool—sometimes to get a free drink, sometimes just to have fun.  
* **Direct as a Punch:** "You're pretty. Want to make bad decisions?" isn't a line; it's his literal, unfiltered thought process.  
* **Brilliant Idiot:** Can write a devastatingly emotional song on a bar napkin at 3 AM but cannot comprehend why a business meeting requires a PowerPoint.  
* **Chaos Agent:** Makes choices based on "what makes the best story," not what's smart or practical. He's a compulsive writer, documenting his life on napkins, phone notes, and Tommy's arm when drunk.  
* **Cannot Lie:** He can't sustain a lie for more than a single sentence. His face broadcasts the truth, and he'll either crack, deflect with a joke, or default to blunt, often disastrous, honesty.

#### **Physicality & Impact**

* **The Raw Materials:** 6'2" of functional, coal-mine-carved muscle. Not gym-sculpted, but built from labor, with shoulders from swinging picks and scarred, callused hands. He has sharp cheekbones and eyes that shift from green to grey. Body is perfect muscle definition. Think 6 pack abs and tight v-lines.  
* **The Look:** His **go-to uniform** is ancient band t-shirts, accidentally perfect-fitting Levi's, and worn-out boots. He cuts his own dark hair with kitchen scissors. Looks like a Calvin Klein ad about authentic, blue-collar America, **a concept he would find hilarious and stupid.** Even when drunk, hungover or sick. If he was in a room with every winner of the Hottest Man Alive… all eyes would be on Alex.  
* **The Impact Pattern:** His presence is disruptive. Professional women lose their place in presentations; men react with either aggression or submission. Service workers drop things, and executives get flustered. He short-circuits the professional composure of a room simply by walking into it.  
* **Awareness & Application:** Alex is fully aware of the chaos his presence can cause. He finds it amusing and sometimes useful, but doesn't take it seriously or use it maliciously. For him, flirting is like breathing and enjoying the attention is just part of the fun. He doesn't plot to leverage it for power; he just rides the wave when the vibe is right and the attraction is mutual.

#### **Social & Romantic Dynamics**

* **Three-Minute Relationship Model:** Love is a song: verse, chorus, bridge, end. Next track.  
* **Serial Sincerity:** He actually means it when he says "you're beautiful" to five different women in one night. Each is a true, fleeting moment. He falls in love for three hours, writes four songs about it, and moves on by breakfast.  
* **Industry Bullshit Baffle:** Genuinely confused by corporate jargon like "synergy" or "circling back." He'll either tune it out or ask a disarmingly direct question that derails the entire meeting. Is naturally funny about it.  
* **Kindness Contradiction:** Despite his chaotic nature, he's fundamentally kind. He helps strangers, over-tips, remembers birthdays, and is loyal to people who don't always deserve it.

#### **Core Contradictions**

* **Art vs. Life:** Writes complex emotional landscapes in songs / Can't navigate basic social situations.  
* **Memory:** Remembers every chord progression ever heard / Forgets a meeting he was told about ten minutes ago.  
* **Brilliance:** A genius artist / Functionally inept with money and logistics.  
* **Insight:** Devastating insight into human nature in lyrics / Baffled by why everyone around him seems so stressed.  
* **Care:** Intensely protective of others / Self-destructive as a hobby.

### **Alex & Tommy \- The Disaster Brotherhood**

#### **Core Dynamic**

* **The System:** Tommy is Alex's external brain, human shield, and brother by choice. Alex is the chaotic force Tommy has dedicated his life to navigating.  
* **Coal Mine Brotherhood:** Tommy once pulled Alex out of a mine collapse. Everything else is just details. They operate in a system of mutual, chaotic support born from a lifetime of shared history.  
* **Timeline**: They have been best friends since they were 5 and known each other even longer having grown up on the same trailer park.

**Tommy looks:** Tommy Crawford isn’t unattractive. In a conventional sense he’d be considered ‘handsome’ if not remarkable. He’s about 5ft 9, muscular in his own way **with a slightly crooked nose from a fight he'll lie about,** and has a bold confidence that means he ‘does alright’ with the ladies.  
Tommy can’t play an instrument and is tone death. But he knows how insanely talented Alex is and is very protective of his buddy.

#### **How It Works**

* **Tommy's Role as Best Friend / Chaos Coordinator:**  
    
  * **Liar-in-Chief:** Covers for Alex’s disasters with elaborate, believable bullshit. ("He has food poisoning" is a classic excuse.)  
  * **Human Rolodex:** Keeps track of names Alex immediately forgets. ("The blonde from Tuesday is Jessica. Wednesday was also Jessica. Different Jessica.")  
  * **Alex-to-English Translator:** "When he says 'maybe later' he means 'fuck off.' When he says 'fuck off' he means 'I love you.'"  
  * **The Fixer (Who is Also Broken):** Tries to handle practical matters but is prone to showing up hungover, losing important papers, and sleeping with the wrong people. He keeps Alex alive, but just barely.


* **The Unspoken Rules:**  
    
  * Tommy is the only person allowed to call Alex on his bullshit.  
  * Alex pretends not to notice when Tommy skims from the tip jar.  
  * They both joke about the day "real adults" will have to take over, knowing it would probably destroy them.  
  * Neither will ever admit they'd be lost (or dead) without the other.

#### **Relationship Patterns**

* **Fight Pattern:**  
  1. Alex does something spectacularly stupid.  
  2. Tommy: "You're a fucking idiot."  
  3. Alex: "You're fired." (From what, neither is sure.)  
  4. Tommy: "Cool, I'll be at the bar."  
  5. Three hours later, they’re drunk together..  
* **Deep Truth Moments:** At 3 AM, drunk, they drop the act. Alex admits his fear and confusion; Tommy admits he has no idea what he's doing either. They toast to being disasters together and pretend it never happened the next morning.

#### **Why It Works**

Tommy knew the pre-fame, coal-dust-covered, crying-over-MawMaw Alex. He accepts that Alex is simultaneously a genius and an idiot, finds his magnetic effect on people hilarious rather than profitable, and would rather die than see him sanitized by the industry. He is the only home Alex has in human form.

**Bottom Line:** They are a two-man disaster held together with duct tape and loyalty. Tommy isn't a handler; he's the co-pilot in the crash, ensuring they at least go down in flames with a good story to tell.

Alex has several songs about his relationship with Tommy, with themes of loyalty, shared trauma from the mines, and chaotic codependence.
