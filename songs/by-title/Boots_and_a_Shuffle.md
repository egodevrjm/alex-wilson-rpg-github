## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Friday night and the work week's done
Got my paycheck burning like the setting sun
Clean shirt on and my lucky hat
Gonna hit the floor where the action's at

Chorus:
All you need is boots and a shuffle
Kick up dust, get out of trouble
Two-step, side-step, heel and toe
Boots and a shuffle, here we go
Boots and a shuffle, that's how we roll

Verse 2:
Saw her standing by the bar alone
Spinning to the jukebox, lost in the zone
Asked her if she'd like to take a turn
She said "Boy, I got some moves to learn"

Chorus:
All you need is boots and a shuffle
Kick up dust, get out of trouble
Two-step, side-step, heel and toe
Boots and a shuffle, here we go
Boots and a shuffle, that's how we roll

Bridge:
Don't need fancy dancing lessons
Just let the music be your blessing
When the fiddle starts to play
Let your boots show you the way

Guitar Solo:
(Instrumental break - fiddle or electric guitar solo over chorus chords)

Chorus:
All you need is boots and a shuffle
Kick up dust, get out of trouble
Two-step, side-step, heel and toe
Boots and a shuffle, here we go
Boots and a shuffle, that's how we roll

Outro:
Boots and a shuffle
That's how we roll
Boots and a shuffle
Saves your soul
Boots and a shuffle
Yeah!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard country band setup â€“ acoustic guitar, electric guitar (Telecaster preferred for twang), bass guitar, drums, fiddle, and optional pedal steel. 

Tempo: Upbeat and driving, perfect for dancing. 

Key: G Major.

Structure: Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Solo-Chorus-Outro. The guitar solo should be relatively short and sweet, focusing on melodic phrasing that complements the song's overall feel. During live performances, encourage audience participation during the 'Boots and a shuffle' chants. The outro can be extended with call-and-response between Alex and the audience (e.g., Alex sings 'Boots and a shuffle,' audience responds with 'That's how we roll'). Fiddle and guitar riffs are placed throughout to add energy.
