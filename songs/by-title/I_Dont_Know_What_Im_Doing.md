## Description
An infectiously upbeat country-pop anthem with a bluegrass heart, "I Don't Know What I'm Doing" captures the charming awkwardness of a backroads charmer stumbling into love. Driven by a lively two-step shuffle at 126 BPM in G major, the song features percussive acoustic guitar strums, playful banjo rolls answering each verse, and twangy electric guitar fills that add a touch of modern edge. A soaring fiddle solo provides an eight-bar lift before the final chorus, while pedal steel subtly weaves its magic beneath the bridge. The baritone lead vocal is confident and engaging, bolstered by tight, stacked harmonies on the choruses. The breakdown strips back to raw handclaps and acoustic guitar, amplifying the impact of the subsequent full-band chorus. The song explores the theme of feeling competent in most areas of life but utterly lost when it comes to matters of the heart, delivering a relatable and endearing message about embracing vulnerability and the willingness to learn.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I’m a bookroads boy—red clay on my boots, a notebook in my hand,
Can quote a line o’ scripture and torque a rusty stand.
I can tune a leaky carb by ear beside the creek,
But miss the hint you’re sendin’ when you brush my arm and speak.
Dolly’s got a dent I hammered flat with luck,
A fistful o’ hay and a banjo in the truck.
You smile like summer thunder rollin’ through this mountain air—
I trip over “hello” like I’m steppin’ off the stair.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m good at most the hard stuff, then I fumble easy things—
Like readin’ hearts or listenin’ for what a silence brings.

[Chorus]
I don’t know what I’m doin’, but I’m doin’ it with style,
Stupid-brilliant, runnin’ hot, half-genius, half-denial.
Got a gift I can’t explain and a compass with no clues,
I don’t know what I’m doin’—but I’d sure learn it with you.

[Verse 2]
I can fix the porch light, play a fiddle double-stop,
Bake cornbread in a skillet and stack lumber like a pro at the shop.
Hear a V-8 miss in A while drivin’ past the mine,
But miss the way you linger when your fingers slide to mine.
I study every star, can name the constellations,
Then call you by your nickname in the wrong conversation.
You laugh and shake your head—says, “Boy, you’re somethin’ bright,”
I say, “Maybe that’s my problem—glowin’ wrong at night.”

[Pre-Chorus]
If brains were spare tires, I’d have four in my bed,
But I still can’t tell a green light from a go-on-home instead.

[Chorus]
I don’t know what I’m doin’, but I’m doin’ it with style,
Stupid-brilliant, runnin’ hot, half-genius, half-denial.
Got a gift I can’t explain and a compass with no clues,
I don’t know what I’m doin’—but I’d sure learn it with you.

[Bridge]
Half backroads, half books, I make maps outta songs,
Turn every wrong turn into right-where-I-belongs.
So if I blow the words again, just grin and pull me near—
I’ll get fluent in your heartbeat, countin’ off in 1-and-2-and-hear.

[Breakdown – speak-sing]
You say I’m stupidly brilliant, hot, crazy talented too—
Well, if that’s true, I need a tutor, and the class is you.

[Final Chorus]
I don’t know what I’m doin’, but I’m doin’ it with style,
Stupid-brilliant, runnin’ hot, half-genius, half-denial.
If lovin’ you’s a puzzle, I’ll be searchin’ out the clues—
I don’t know what I’m doin’… but I know it’s you.

[Tag]
Bookroads boy—two left feet, still dancin’ into true.
Yeah, two left feet, still dancin' into you.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (steel-string, Martin D-28 or similar), Banjo (5-string, Scruggs style), Electric Guitar (Telecaster or similar, with a slight overdrive tone), Fiddle (standard tuning, bluegrass style), Pedal Steel Guitar, Upright Bass (or electric bass with upright tone), Drums (snare on 2 and 4, brush accents, emphasis on kick and hi-hat for the shuffle feel), Handclaps (during the breakdown). Consider a mandolin doubling the fiddle melody on the 8 bar lift before the final chorus. Harmony parts should be tight and well-blended, ideally a tenor and baritone harmony above the lead vocal. The stop-time gag on "stupidly brilliant" requires precise timing from all instrumentalists and vocalists. During the breakdown, the speak-sing delivery should be conversational and slightly humorous. The overall mood is lighthearted and optimistic, despite the theme of feeling lost.
