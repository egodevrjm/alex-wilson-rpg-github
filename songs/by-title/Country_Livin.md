## Description
An upbeat and infectious country anthem celebrating the joys of rural life, community spirit, and simple pleasures. Alex Wilson's warm and energetic vocals, delivered with a touch of Southern drawl, soar over a mid-tempo, driving rhythm. The song features bright acoustic guitar strums, playful banjo licks, a steady, lively drumbeat, soaring fiddle fills, and rich, harmonious backing vocals. Verses tell relatable stories of country living, pre-choruses build anticipation, and choruses explode with singalong energy and crowd-chant potential. A brief, intimate acoustic bridge provides a moment of reflection before the song surges back to its vibrant conclusion. The overall mood is joyful, nostalgic, and inviting, evoking images of backyard barbecues, lazy afternoons by the riverbank, and starlit nights. Fades out with echoing banjo riffs and enthusiastic cheers.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Bright acoustic guitar strum with banjo, fun and catchy for radio play)

(Verse 1)
Out in the country, grass grows high,
Wake to birds singin' in the sky.
Load the truck, head to the stream,
Fish all day, livin' the dream.
No big crowds, just open space,
Laugh with friends, feel the grace.

(Pre-Chorus)
Sunday church, family meal,
Bonfire nights, keep it real.

(Chorus - Stronger hook, simple and memorable, full band pop-country vibe)
Country livin', yeah that's my jam,
Fishin' poles and helpin' hands.
Barbecue smoke, bluegrass tunes,
Stars at night, under the moon.
Country livin', wild and true,
Nothin' better for me and you.
Raise a glass, let out a cheer,
Country livin' is why we're here!

(Verse 2)
Grandma's pie fresh from the oven,
Kids run free, full of lovin'.
Hunt in fall, share what we get,
Neighbors chat, no regret.
Porch swings sway, stories flow,
Fireflies put on a show.

(Pre-Chorus)
Stick together, rain or shine,
This life's sweet, feels divine.

(Chorus - Energetic build, easy singalong)
Country livin', yeah that's my jam,
Fishin' poles and helpin' hands.
Barbecue smoke, bluegrass tunes,
Stars at night, under the moon.
Country livin', wild and true,
Nothin' better for me and you.
Raise a glass, let out a cheer,
Country livin' is why we're here!

(Bridge - Light acoustic, quick build)
No city noise, just peace we find,
Good folks with hearts so kind.
Fish, farm, dance in the dirt,
Country life's where it don't hurt.
Got my boots and my faded jeans
Living out my wildest dreams

(Chorus - Big finale, fun and uplifting)
Country livin', yeah that's my jam,
Fishin' poles and helpin' hands.
Barbecue smoke, bluegrass tunes,
Stars at night, under the moon.
Country livin', wild and true,
Nothin' better for me and you.
Raise a glass, let out a cheer,
Country livin' is why we're here!

(Outro - Fade with banjo and cheers)
Yeah, country livin'...
Why we're here!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (prominent strumming), banjo (rhythmic plucking and fills), drums (steady kick and snare, with subtle hi-hat variations), bass guitar (walking bass lines), fiddle (melodic fills and solos), backing vocals (harmonizing on the chorus and pre-chorus). Dynamic Changes: Start with a relatively stripped-down verse, building to a powerful chorus. Use a dynamic bridge for contrast. Chorus: The chorus should be the most energetic and powerful part of the song. Consider adding a slight key change on the final chorus to further enhance the emotional impact. Vocal Harmonies: Use harmonies in the pre-chorus and chorus to create a fuller sound. Consider layering harmonies for the final chorus. Banjo fills and riffs should be catchy and memorable. Fiddle solos should be energetic and expressive. The outro should gradually fade out with banjo echoing, layered with the cheering sounds of a happy crowd to add an authentic touch.
