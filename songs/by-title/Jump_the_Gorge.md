## Description
A high-octane bluegrass-infused country romp that celebrates reckless abandon and small-town legend-making. "Jump the Gorge" tells the story of a daredevil and their trusty, beat-up Ford truck named Betty, attempting an impossible jump over a local gorge. Driven by a blazing train-strum acoustic guitar and a clawhammer banjo weaving a ramp-run groove, the song explodes in the chorus with a gritty baritone Telecaster and fiddle playing unison riffs. The upright bass walks the off-beats, while punchy kick and snare provide a driving backbeat reminiscent of tailgate parties. A harmonica wails during the breakdown, and short, fiery solos pass between the Telecaster, fiddle, and banjo. Gang vocals lift the final chorus, creating a raw, energetic, and spontaneous live feel that captures the spirit of the story.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Tommy’s white-knuckled on my sleeve sayin’, “Buddy, don’t you dare,”
“I seen that creek chew bumpers, son—she’ll eat that truck for spare.”
But Betty’s got that crooked grin, primer gray and dented pride,
Three on the tree, a dashboard rosary of duct tape hangin’ wide.
I chalked the ramp on feed-sack math—two pallets, one old door,
Said, “Tommy, hold my sweet tea—watch a legend leave the shore.”

Pre-Chorus
He says, “Use your head.” I say, “I did—
It told my heart to take the lid.”

Chorus
Gonna jump the gorge in Betty tonight,
Headlights aimed at a patch of sky.
If I land on halo, I’ll wave it hello,
If I land in rhododendron, I’ll still die a pro.
Tommy yells, “Don’t!” but I’m hearin’ “Go!”—
This story needs a porch, a crowd, and smoke.
Yeah, jump the gorge—let the holler record:
It’s me, not sense, behind this Ford.

Verse 2
Tommy’s got a ratchet set and every prayer he knows,
Checks my lug nuts like a surgeon, shakes his head and goes,
“Betty’s forty years of potholes, leaks, and borrowed parts—
This ain’t NASCAR glory; it’s a coupon for new hearts.”
I pat the fender, whisper low, “Girl, we always liked a dare.”
Tommy shoves a helmet at me: “At least pretend you care.”

Pre-Chorus
He says, “Live to drink and laugh at this.”
I say, “Laughs ain’t free—you buy ‘em with risk.”

Chorus
Gonna jump the gorge in Betty tonight,
Tailgate hummin’ like a neon sign.
If I kiss the gravel, let ‘em paint the road,
“Here lies physics—outvoted by bold.”
Tommy yells, “Don’t!” but I’m hearin’ “Go!”—
Crowd’s countin’ down like a metronome.
Yeah, jump the gorge—let the ridge applaud:
Two fools, one truck, and a wink from God.

Breakdown (Talk-Sing)
Tommy: “Man, this ramp’s a rumor.”
Me: “Rumors fly.”
Tommy: “So will you… straight down.”
Me: “Trust the porch-math.”
Tommy: “You used chalk.”
Me: “Chalk is science that erases easy.”

Instrumental Bridge
(Banjo Solo - Fast, furious, and slightly chaotic. Fiddle answers with a soaring, slightly sarcastic riff. Telecaster joins in with a bluesy lick.)

Verse 3
Clutch out—Betty coughs—then clears her righteous throat,
Carb breath sweet as county fair and second-hand remote.
Rocks blur past; time slows up; a gnat waves how-you-been,
Tommy’s “Nooooo” turns into wind, then into violin.
We’re weightless over blackberry and gossip, thorns and lore—
Betty lands like church bells… then we bounce once more.

Lifted Chorus
We jumped the gorge—Betty, me, and grit,
Skid-mark autograph where tires kissed it.
If I’d met the laurel, I’d still sign the tale,
“Some dreams ain’t meant for brakes to scale.”
Tommy runs up cussin’, then laughs till he cries,
Says, “You absolute idiot… I’m proud you’re alive.”
Yeah, jump the gorge—write it on the store,
“CLOSED FOR CHEERING: BETTY SOARED.”

Tag
Tommy’s hand on my shoulder, “Let’s never again.”
I grin at Betty’s hood: “So… same time when?”

Outro
(A final, quick run of the chorus riff by the fiddle and banjo, fading out with the sound of Betty's engine sputtering happily.)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic Guitar (Train-strum rhythm), Clawhammer Banjo (Intertwining with guitar), Telecaster (Gritty, baritone tone for chorus riffs and solos), Fiddle (Soaring, slightly sarcastic tone for chorus riffs and solos), Upright Bass or Woody P-Bass (Walking the 'and' of the beat), Drums (Punchy kick and snare, evoking a tailgate party feel), Harmonica (Wails during the breakdown), Gang Vocals (Chorus and potentially the lifted chorus).
Tempo: 126 BPM in cut time (2/2 time signature).
Key: A Major (Energetic and bright).
Structure: The song follows a standard verse-chorus structure with a pre-chorus, a breakdown section featuring talk-singing, an instrumental bridge with solos, a lifted chorus, a tag, and an outro.
Performance Notes: Emphasize the raw, energetic feel of a live performance. The instruments should be played with a slight edge and a sense of urgency. The vocals should be gritty and expressive. The gang vocals should be enthusiastic and slightly out of tune, adding to the sense of a spontaneous celebration. The solos should be short and fiery, showcasing the virtuosity of the musicians without losing the overall momentum of the song. The mix should be balanced but slightly unpolished, capturing the imperfections and quirks of a live recording. The train-strum acoustic guitar style should be prominent, maintaining the constant forward motion of the song. The banjo should complement the guitar, adding intricate melodic flourishes and rhythmic complexity.
The harmonica should have a slightly dirty, bluesy tone. Use a dynamic microphone for the vocals to capture the nuances of the performance.
Consider using a slapback delay on the vocals to enhance the vintage feel.
The upright bass should be miked with both a microphone and a pickup to capture both the acoustic and electric aspects of the instrument.
