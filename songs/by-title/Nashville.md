## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Started with a fiddle on a front porch swing,
Carter Family voices makin’ mountains sing.
That sound rolled south on a midnight train,
Brought the high lonesome to a brand-new stage.
Mother Maybelle’s pickin’ rang clear and true,
Lit a spark in a town that the whole world knew.
From WSM’s waves to the Opry floor,
Every song opened one more door.

(Chorus)
Nashville—where the heart beats in four-four time,
From the Ryman pews to the neon signs.
Every dreamer with a guitar comes to stand,
In the shadow of Studio C and a calloused hand.
Yeah, the story keeps on rollin’ still,
In a song called Nashville.

(Verse 2)
Hank poured his soul into “Lovesick Blues,”
Cash walked the line in black leather shoes.
Patsy’s voice floated through the Opry Hall,
While Dolly sewed dreams from rags and shawls.
That old RCA room with the echo tight,
Pressed gold out of heartache night after night.
From steel and twang to outlaw grit,
Every chord said “Son, don’t you quit.”

(Chorus)
Nashville—where the heart beats in four-four time,
From the Ryman pews to the neon signs.
Every dreamer with a guitar comes to stand,
In the shadow of Studio C and a calloused hand.
Yeah, the story keeps on rollin’ still,
In a song called Nashville.

(Bridge)
From the Loveless Café to Lower Broad,
You’ll find a truth that can’t be flawed.
Where young blood plays for tips and tips alone,
On the same streets the legends called home.
It’s a circle unbroken, a hymn that binds,
Past to present in three chords and lines.

(Guitar Solo)

(Final Chorus – soaring with harmony)
Nashville—where the heart beats in four-four time,
From the Ryman pews to the neon signs.
Every dreamer with a guitar comes to stand,
In the shadow of Studio C and a calloused hand.
From the Carters’ day to the stars that will,
Write the next verse of Nashville.

(Outro)
Yeah, every song’s got a place to fill…
In the book of Nashville.
Ooooh-ooooh, Nashville

Tempo: Mid-tempo ballad, suitable for easy listening and singalongs. Dynamics: Build from quiet intro to a powerful final chorus. Pay attention to dynamics within verses to highlight key lyrics.
