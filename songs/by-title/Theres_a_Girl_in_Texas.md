## Description
A bittersweet yet empowering pop-country anthem. The song opens intimately with strummed acoustic guitar and the mournful cry of pedal steel, setting the stage for Alex Wilson's smooth vocals, delivered with a hint of Texas drawl. As the verses unfold, layers of twangy electric guitar, light banjo riffs, crisp drums, and subtle synth pads build the energy. The explosive choruses feature soaring fiddle melodies, rich backing harmonies, and driving gang vocals. The bridge offers a moment of quiet reflection before the final, emotionally charged chorus. The song concludes with a haunting outro that fades on echoing guitar and a distant, lonesome harmonica.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
I pull into another town, guitar in the back seat,
Spotlight hits me hard, but my mind's on repeat.
Singin' 'bout lost loves and neon-lit regrets,
Crowd sings along, but they don't know the half yet.
I've got stories stacked like records on a shelf,
Each one a piece of me, a chapter of myself.
But late at night, when the applause fades away,
I think about the ones who think they know what I say.

(Pre-Chorus)
They hear their names in every broken line,
But the truth's a little different every time.

(Chorus)
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’
She pictures us dancin' under barroom glow,
But that song was born from a heart she don't know.
Oh, there's a girl in Texas, holdin' on so tight,
To a memory that fades into the night.
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’

(Verse 2)
There's a sweetheart in Nashville who swears it's her smile,
In the verses of 'Whiskey Goodbye' for a while.
And a beauty in Memphis claims 'Riverbank Blues,'
Thinks that melody's hers, but she's got it confused.
I've loved and I've lost in a hundred small towns,
Wrote it all down when the world let me down.
But that one hit single, the one on the charts,
Came from a place deeper in my heart.

(Pre-Chorus)
It's not about blame or pointin' fingers now,
Just the way life twists and turns somehow.

(Chorus)
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’
She pictures us dancin' under barroom glow,
But that song was born from a heart she don't know.
Oh, there's a girl in Texas, holdin' on so tight,
To a memory that fades into the night.
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’

(Bridge)
The truth is that tune came from a lonely motel,
Starin' at the ceiling, fightin' my own hell.
It wasn't her eyes or her laugh in the dark,
It was me findin' peace with my own broken heart.
So if she's listenin', I hope she understands,
Sometimes a song's just a man makin' his stand.

(Chorus)
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’
She pictures us dancin' under barroom glow,
But that song was born from a heart she don't know.
Oh, there's a girl in Texas, holdin' on so tight,
To a memory that fades into the night.
There’s a girl in Texas who still waits by the phone,
Thinkin’ she’s the reason I wrote ‘Neon Alone.’

(Outro)
Yeah, thinkin’ she’s the reason...
‘Neon Alone.’

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar, electric guitars (twangy lead and rhythm), pedal steel, banjo, drums, bass, subtle synth pads, fiddle, backing vocals (harmonies and gang shouts), harmonica. 
Tempo: Moderately upbeat, driving. 
Mood: Bittersweet, reflective, empowering. 
Production: Aim for a polished, contemporary country sound with a slightly raw edge. Pay attention to vocal layering and harmonies in the choruses. Emphasize the interplay between the acoustic and electric instruments. The outro should have a spacious, echoing feel. During the bridge, the music should pull back dynamically, creating a more intimate and vulnerable feel before building back up for the final chorus. The drum fills should be subtle but impactful. Consider adding a subtle delay or reverb to the vocal to enhance the emotional impact.
