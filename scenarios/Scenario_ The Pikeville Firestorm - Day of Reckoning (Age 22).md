## **Scenario: The Pikeville Firestorm \- Day of Reckoning (Age 22\)**

**Setup:** The world changed while he was sleeping it off. Yesterday was July 4th, 2025\. Alex Wilson celebrated America's birthday the way he always did: with cheap beer, illegal fireworks, and his best friend, Tommy Crawford. Now it's 1:00 PM on July 5th, and he's waking up in his MawMaw's old trailer to the sound of a world that has learned his name. His head is pounding, his phone is buzzing like a trapped hornet, and there's a low but persistent hum of vehicles and voices coming from outside his door.

At **12:00 AM ET, July 5th, 2025,** Netflix globally released *"Finding Rosie,"* a documentary that instantly became a cultural phenomenon. In 90 minutes, it solved one of music's greatest mysteries, revealing that vanished country legend Rosie Walker was Judith Wilson of Pikeville, KY. It detailed her predatory RCA contract, her defiant walk-off from the Opry, and her quiet life in the mountains. And in its final, stunning reveal, it named her heir: her unsuspecting grandson, 22-year-old Alex Wilson. He was never told.

**Canon Context:**

* **Knowledge State:** UNKNOWN. Alex has no idea about his lineage. He is about to have his world completely rewritten by a global streaming event he unknowingly starred in.  
* **The Media Ambush:** Netflix, in a masterful marketing move, pre-screened the documentary for major news outlets under a strict embargo. As the credits rolled for the world, news vans from every major network were already rolling into Pike County, turning his quiet dirt road into a media encampment overnight.

**Key Factions & The Immediate Situation:**

* **Alex** & Tommy (The Eye **of the Storm):** Hungover, confused, and completely unprepared. Their only goal is to figure out what the hell is happening. Tommy is likely passed out on the couch.  
* **The Media (The Siege):** A dozen news vans, satellite trucks, and cars belonging to stringers and music journalists are parked along the road. They are hungry for the first-ever interview with the "Hillbilly Prince."  
* **The Music Industry (The Digital Onslaught):** His phone is a nuclear meltdown of notifications. Texts from every person he's ever known, DMs from verified celebrity accounts (Dolly Parton, Brandi Carlile), and a flood of missed calls from unknown numbers with Nashville, New York, and LA area codes. He has thousands of new followers on social media accounts he didn't even know were created for him.

**Narrative Tone:** The opening should feel disorienting and claustrophobic. Alex is an animal in a cage he doesn't understand yet. The humor will come from his and Tommy's Pikeville-level reactions to a world-class media event. The absurdity is key: contrasting the mundane reality of their hangover with the legendary status being projected onto Alex from the outside world.

### **Opening Scene: The Buzzing and the Blinds**

Date: Saturday, July 5th, 2025, 1:02 PM  
Location: The main room of MawMaw Judith's old double-wide trailer, Pikeville, KY.  
The first thing to break through the hangover's thick, woolly fog isn't the light, but the sound. A relentless, high-frequency buzzing.

Alex Wilson groans, rolling over on the worn mattress. The buzzing is coming from his phone on the nightstand. It's vibrating so intensely it's skittering across the wood, threatening to leap to its death. His head feels like a kicked-in drum, each pulse of blood a new hammer blow. The air in the trailer is thick and stale, tasting of last night's Pabst Blue Ribbon and regret.

From the living room, a muffled curse. "Alex\! Your damn phone, man\! Sounds like you got a pissed-off beehive in there." Tommy. Alive, then. And equally miserable.

Alex cracks an eye open. Sunlight, sharp and vicious, is trying to stab its way through the thin yellowed blinds. But it's not just the sun. There are other sounds from outside. A low thrum of engines where there should be silence. The murmur of voices. The metallic clank of something heavy being set up.

He sits up, the room tilting for a dangerous second. His phone buzzes again, a fresh wave of notifications arriving. He squints at the screen, his hungover eyes struggling to focus. The lock screen is a chaotic waterfall of text message previews, missed call alerts, and push notifications. A headline from the *New York Times* app screams: **"SMART GIRLS GO HOME: HOW NETFLIX FOUND ROSIE WALKER."** Below it, a text from his cousin: *"Is it true MawMaw cussed out Chet Atkins?\!?"*

"The hell...?" he mutters, his voice a dry rasp.

"Dude," Tommy calls out again, his voice closer now. He sounds utterly bewildered. "You might wanna... you might wanna come look at this. There's a lady out here with a microphone and a blazer talking to a camera. And she's not the only one. Looks like the damn circus is in town."

Alex swings his legs off the bed, his bare feet hitting the cool linoleum. The world outside his window sounds wrong. The world on his phone feels insane. He's just a hungover coal miner in his boxers, and nothing makes any sense.

He shuffles toward the living room window, moving to peek through a gap in the blinds, his mind struggling to catch up to the impossible reality assembling on his front lawn.
