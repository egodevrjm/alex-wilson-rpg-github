## Description
A nostalgic pop-country ballad about the journey of leaving home, seeking new horizons, and ultimately discovering the enduring power and comfort of one's roots. Alex Wilson's warm, reflective vocals, imbued with a subtle drawl, guide the listener through a bittersweet tale of self-discovery.

Intended for fans of artists such as Zac Brown Band, Chris Stapleton (softer side), and early Keith Urban.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Gentle acoustic guitar picking with soft fiddle, evoking a nostalgic drive through rural roads, building to mid-tempo country ballad)

(Verse 1)
Packed my old duffle, hit that dusty highway line,
Left the front porch swing and the sweet tea vine.
City lights were callin', promised somethin' new,
Thought I'd find my freedom far from what I knew.
But the nights grew longer, the crowds felt so cold,
Missed the backroad whispers and stories told.

(Pre-Chorus)
Had to wander far to see what I'd left behind,
That pull in my heart, the ties that bind.

(Chorus - Emotional, anthemic hook with harmonies and pedal steel swells)
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while,
Through the miles and the trials, they bring you back with a smile.
Sometimes you gotta roam to know where you belong,
Roots don’t break, they just hold on strong.
Yeah, roots don’t break, they call you home again,
Through the wind and the rain, like an old faithful friend.
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while.

(Verse 2)
Saw the world in colors I’d never dreamed before,
But every skyline faded, leavin' me wantin' more.
The taste of adventure turned a little bittersweet,
When the echoes of home started tappin' at my feet.
Learned that leavin' teaches what you can't replace,
That sense of belongin' in a familiar place.

(Pre-Chorus)
Distance makes the heart grow wise and true,
Pullin' you back to the ones who shaped you.

(Chorus - Building intensity, full band with fiddle accents)
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while,
Through the miles and the trials, they bring you back with a smile.
Sometimes you gotta roam to know where you belong,
Roots don’t break, they just hold on strong.
Yeah, roots don’t break, they call you home again,
Through the wind and the rain, like an old faithful friend.
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while.

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic intimacy, then rises)
Now I'm turnin' 'round, headin' back to my ground,
Where the heart finds its beat, where true peace is found.
Had to lose my way to appreciate the view,
Of the place that made me, through and through.
The faces I missed, the stories untold,
Worth more than silver or anything gold.

(Chorus - Massive, heartfelt finale with crowd-ready harmonies)
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while,
Through the miles and the trials, they bring you back with a smile.
Sometimes you gotta roam to know where you belong,
Roots don’t break, they just hold on strong.
Yeah, roots don’t break, they call you home again,
Through the wind and the rain, like an old faithful friend.
Roots don’t break, they just stretch a while.

(Outro - Fades with soft guitar and fiddle hum)
Roots don’t break... they just stretch a while...
Callin' me home... mile after mile.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard country band setup: Male lead vocals, backing harmonies, acoustic guitar (primarily fingerpicked), electric guitar (subtle lead lines), pedal steel guitar (providing sustained chords and fills), fiddle (melodic accents and countermelodies), bass guitar (walking bass lines), and drums (light and supportive rhythm). 
Tempo: Mid-tempo, approximately 84 BPM. 
Key: G Major. 
Structure: Standard verse-chorus structure with a bridge. 
Performance Notes: The intro should be played with a warm, intimate tone, gradually building in intensity as the song progresses. Pedal steel swells should be used sparingly but effectively to enhance the emotional impact of the choruses. Fiddle accents should be tasteful and complement the melody, rather than overpowering it. Harmonies should be tight and blend well with the lead vocal. The bridge provides an opportunity for the lead vocalist to showcase their emotional range. The outro should fade out gradually, leaving the listener with a feeling of peaceful contentment. Drummer should use brushes for a softer feel on the verses and rim shots to accent the snare on the chorus. Fiddle should play a short motif during the instrumental breaks between verses and choruses. Bass follows root notes but adds passing tones for interest.
