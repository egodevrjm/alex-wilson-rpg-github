## Description
A nostalgic and emotionally resonant pop-country anthem that explores the bittersweet memories of young love and reckless abandon. Built upon a foundation of polished, beat-driven production, the track seamlessly blends infectious electric guitar riffs with a tight, modern drum groove. Confident, conversational vocals in the verses give way to surging, anthemic choruses layered with guitars, bold harmonies, and dynamic rhythm shifts. The song marries slick pop hooks with raw country emotion and youthful swagger, capturing the essence of small-town life and the ache of lost innocence.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Two years ago, man, we owned this town
Sun settin' gold as the dust kicked 'round my tires
Your hand on my knee, had that look in your eye
Felt like we were runnin' on pure bonfire.
Stood in that line with a wallet and a lie
You'd flash that smile, I'd flash that plastic grin
The bouncer just nodded, didn't even ask why
Felt like a king every time he let us in.

(Pre-Chorus)
Yeah, we were underage and over-the-top
Orderin' two whiskeys, prayin' we wouldn't get caught
Felt like Bonnie and Clyde with nothin' to lose
Just a couple of kids breakin' all the rules...

(Chorus)
We were Fake IDs in a real love story
Livin' on borrowed time and a whole lotta glory
Just a picture of a stranger, a name that wasn't mine
But the girl right beside me was one of a kind
Now I'm twenty-one and the whiskey's pourin' free
But all I taste are the real tears you cried over me.

(Verse 2)
Remember that night by the cheap neon light?
You said my name and you laced your hand in mine
Swore that "us" was the only thing that felt true
That nothin' could touch me when I was with you.
But the thing about games is someone gets tired
The little white lies get tangled in the wire
One stupid fight, one slam of a car door
And we weren't playin' that game anymore.

(Pre-Chorus)
Yeah, we were underage and flyin' way too high
Thought we could live forever in that cheap July sky
Felt like king and queen with nothin' to lose
Didn't know that kinda love could leave a black and blue...

(Chorus)
We were Fake IDs in a real love story
Livin' on borrowed time and a whole lotta glory
Just a picture of a stranger, a name that wasn't mine
But the girl right beside me was one of a kind
Now I'm twenty-one and the whiskey's pourin' free
But all I taste are the real tears you cried over me.

(Bridge)
Walked in tonight, didn't even have to try
The guy at the door just waved me on by.
Feels kinda hollow, feels kinda strange
How a couple of birthdays can make everything change.
I should be celebratin', feelin' proud and new
But this whole damn bar just feels empty without you.

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
YEAH, WE WERE FAKE IDs IN A REAL LOVE STORY!
LIVIN' ON BORROWED TIME AND A WHOLE LOTTA GLORY!
JUST A PICTURE OF A STRANGER, A NAME THAT WASN'T MINE,
BUT THE GIRL RIGHT BESIDE ME WAS ONE OF A KIND!
NOW I'M TWENTY-ONE AND THE WHISKEY'S POURIN' FREE,
BUT ALL I TASTE ARE THE REAL TEARS... THE REAL TEARS YOU CRIED OVER ME!

(Outro)
Yeah, the real tears...
You cried over me.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Lead vocals, backing vocals, electric guitars (clean and distorted), bass guitar, drums (acoustic and programmed elements), possibly a subtle synth pad for added texture.
Tempo: Moderately fast, suitable for dancing and singalongs.
Mood: Nostalgic, bittersweet, with a blend of youthful energy and reflective sadness.
Guitar Solo: Should be melodic and emotive, incorporating country-style bends and licks, building in intensity throughout its duration. Consider using a wah pedal sparingly for added expression.
Outro: The final kick-drum beat should be heavily compressed and slightly delayed to emphasize the feeling of emptiness and finality.
Vocals: Lead vocal performance should convey both confidence and vulnerability. Backing vocals in the choruses should be tight and harmonically rich, adding to the anthemic feel.
