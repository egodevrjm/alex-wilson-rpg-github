## Description
A heartfelt mid-tempo country ballad in E major, "Dashboard Jesus Don't Judge" explores themes of guilt, redemption, and the quiet understanding found in unexpected places. Warm acoustic guitar leads the way, complemented by subtle Dobro fills that paint gentle textures of regret and longing. A steady 4/4 time signature provides a relaxed, swaying rhythm, while the verses and choruses gracefully move through a classic I-IV-V chord progression. The bridge offers a shift to the relative minor (C#m), adding depth and emotional complexity before returning to the comforting familiarity of the chorus. A poignant reflection on the burdens we carry and the silent witnesses to our journeys.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1:]
  Lipstick on my collar, perfume on my seat
  Another late night secret I can't seem to keep
  You're the only one who sees me when I slide in at dawn
  Nodding your head gently as I drive on

[Chorus:]
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  Been running low on grace and love
  You've seen all my midnight drives
  My heartbreak alibis
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  You're the only friend I trust
  Keep nodding through my sins
  As these wheels spin and spin

[Verse 2:]
  Three missed calls blinking, one more lie to tell
  These back road decisions ain't serving me well
  But you keep on smiling through my rear view shame
  Never once complaining, never placing blame

[Chorus:]
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  Been running low on grace and love
  You've seen all my midnight drives
  My heartbreak alibis
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  You're the only friend I trust
  Keep nodding through my sins
  As these wheels spin and spin

[Bridge:]
  Sometimes I wonder what you'd say
  If that plastic head could speak today
  But you just keep on bouncing along
  While I keep doing wrong

[Chorus:]
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  Been running low on grace and love
  You've seen all my midnight drives
  My heartbreak alibis
  Dashboard Jesus don't judge
  You're the only friend I trust
  Keep nodding through my sins
  As these wheels spin and spin

[Outro:]
  Spin and spin...
  Dashboard Jesus...
  Keep nodding...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (lead and rhythm), Dobro (subtle fills and texture), Bass guitar (walking bass line), Drums (brushes on snare for a relaxed feel), Pedal Steel (optional, for added country flavor on the bridge or outro).
Tempo: Mid-tempo, leaning towards a relaxed feel. Consider a slight push and pull in the tempo to emphasize the emotional weight of certain lyrics.
Key: E Major. The bridge modulates to C# minor (relative minor) for contrast.
Dynamics: Build slightly through the verses and choruses, reaching a peak during the bridge. Maintain a generally subdued and introspective feel.
Vocals: A slightly raspy, heartfelt vocal delivery would enhance the authenticity of the song. Consider adding subtle harmonies on the choruses to emphasize the message.
The Dobro fills should be carefully placed and not overbearing, serving to highlight key lyrical moments.
The bass should play a simple walking bassline that locks in with the kick drum to create a solid groove.
Brushes on the snare drum will give a light airy feel.
