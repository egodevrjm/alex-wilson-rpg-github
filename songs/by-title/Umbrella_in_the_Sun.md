## Description
A clever, metaphor-driven country-pop crossover about rolling with the punches when everything goes wrong. 'Umbrella in the Sun' blends bright pop production with a touch of acoustic country texture, leaning heavier toward pop radio sensibilities while keeping Alex Wilson’s grounded lyrical voice intact.
Upbeat country-pop crossover spotlighting jangly acoustic guitar and buoyant pop rhythms, layered with crisp percussion and a vibrant bassline. The verses feature subtle banjo and steel guitar, while glossy synths lift the chorus. Bridge strips back for intimacy before a radiant full-band finish.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Spilled my coffee on a brand-new shirt,
Hit every red light, made it worse.
Phone keeps buzzin’ with the same old news,
Feels like the world’s got nothin’ to lose.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just laugh, say “what the hell,”
If life’s a joke, I’ll play it well.

[Chorus]
It’s one of those days, where the clouds won’t break,
Like bringin’ an umbrella to the desert by mistake.
Everything’s sideways, nothin’ goes right,
But even wrong turns still shine in the light.
Yeah, it’s one of those days,
And I’ll dance through the rain anyway.

[Verse 2]
Dropped my keys in the grocery line,
Sang the wrong words, but the tune was mine.
Neighbors starin’ like I lost my mind,
But maybe that’s just freedom in disguise.

[Pre-Chorus]
If the universe is playin’ games,
I’ll play along, I’ll love the flames.

[Chorus]
It’s one of those days, where the clouds won’t break,
Like bringin’ an umbrella to the desert by mistake.
Everything’s sideways, nothin’ goes right,
But even wrong turns still shine in the light.
Yeah, it’s one of those days,
And I’ll dance through the rain anyway.

[Bridge]
Maybe it’s fate with a twisted grin,
Showin’ me loss is where joy begins.
Life’s little storms, they don’t last long,
Every bad line still makes a song.

[Final Chorus]
It’s one of those days, where the clouds won’t break,
Like singin’ hallelujah when your heart just aches.
Everything’s sideways, nothin’ goes right,
But even the darkness can spark up the night.
Yeah, it’s one of those days,
But I’ll dance through the rain anyway.

[Outro]
Umbrella in the sun… yeah, I’ll laugh ‘til it’s done.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Bright four-on-the-floor beat, shimmering synth pads, and acoustic guitar strums tucked low in the mix. Pop-forward production with layered harmonies and a subtle banjo for texture. Tempo ~112 BPM, polished arrangement, with an anthemic pop chorus designed for radio crossover appeal.
