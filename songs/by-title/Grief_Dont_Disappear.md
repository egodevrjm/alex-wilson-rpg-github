## Lyrics

(Intro - Gentle acoustic guitar picking with soft pedal steel, creating a reflective pop-country ballad vibe, like a quiet evening on a porch processing loss)

(Verse 1)
Daddy's old chair sits empty by the fire,
Mama's laugh echoes in the telephone wire.
Days turn to months, but the ache stays the same,
Whispers of "why" in the pourin' rain.
I pick up my guitar, strings worn and thin,
Let the hurt flow out, let the healin' begin.

(Pre-Chorus)
Tears on the frets, memories in the tune,
Turnin' pain into somethin' under the moon.

(Chorus - Emotional, catchy hook with harmonies and fiddle accents)
Grief don’t disappear, but sometimes it rhymes,
In a melody soft as the passin' of time.
It lingers like shadows in the back of my mind,
But I sing it out loud, leave the darkness behind.
Grief don’t disappear, it just changes its form,
From a storm in my heart to a song in the storm.
Yeah, grief don’t disappear... but sometimes it rhymes.

(Verse 2)
Brother's gone too soon, left a hole in the yard,
Sister's voice faded, hittin' me hard.
Nights are the longest when the quiet creeps in,
But I strum through the silence, let the words spin.
Each chord's a memory, each line a release,
Findin' peace in the pieces, makin' my peace.

(Pre-Chorus)
Notes on the page, like stars in the night,
Guidin' me forward into the light.

(Chorus - Building with full band, heartfelt delivery)
Grief don’t disappear, but sometimes it rhymes,
In a melody soft as the passin' of time.
It lingers like shadows in the back of my mind,
But I sing it out loud, leave the darkness behind.
Grief don’t disappear, it just changes its form,
From a storm in my heart to a song in the storm.
Yeah, grief don’t disappear... but sometimes it rhymes.

(Bridge - Music pulls back to intimate acoustic, then swells)
It ain't about forgettin', it's 'bout carryin' on,
Weavin' the sorrow into a brand new dawn.
One note at a time, one verse to heal,
Turnin' what broke me into somethin' real.

(Chorus - Soaring finale, emotional peak with crowd-ready harmonies)
Grief don’t disappear, but sometimes it rhymes,
In a melody soft as the passin' of time.
It lingers like shadows in the back of my mind,
But I sing it out loud, leave the darkness behind.
Grief don’t disappear, it just changes its form,
From a storm in my heart to a song in the storm.
Yeah, grief don’t disappear... but sometimes it rhymes.

(Outro - Fades with acoustic echoes and a soft hum, repeating the main theme)
Sometimes it rhymes... grief don't disappear.
But in this song... it's crystal clear. 
Grief don't disappear...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked arpeggios), pedal steel guitar (subtle swells and textures), fiddle (accenting melodies and harmonies), light drums (brushes on snare, gentle kick), bass guitar (simple, supportive line), backing vocals (harmonies on choruses). Key is A Major.
Tempo: 84 BPM, creating a comfortable, reflective pace. 
Vocals: Alex Wilson's lead vocal should be delivered with raw emotion and sincerity, emphasizing the vulnerability of the lyrics. Backing vocals should provide subtle harmonies, building in intensity during the choruses. Pay close attention to the dynamic arc, building from the intimate verses to the soaring choruses and bridge. Outro should gradually fade, leaving a lingering sense of peace and hope, ending with the final acoustic echo.
