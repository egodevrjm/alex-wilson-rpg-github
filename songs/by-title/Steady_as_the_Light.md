## Description
A tender, slow-dance pop-country ballad, "Steady as the Light" is an intimate declaration of enduring love. Built around a gentle 6/8 time signature at 72 BPM in the key of G major, the song features a warm and inviting instrumental arrangement. Finger-picked acoustic guitar and delicate piano lines intertwine, supported by the steady pulse of an upright bass. Brush snare and shaker add subtle rhythmic texture, while pedal steel and fiddle provide emotive swells and countermelodies. Alex Wilson's heartfelt vocal performance, doubled with a single harmony on the choruses, is the centerpiece of this unforgettable wedding song. A subtle pad elevates the final chorus, culminating in a beautifully sustained ending on the word "light," with a lingering pedal steel tail and piano cadence. The song's structure and duration are ideally suited for a one-take first dance.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
You’re the porch light on my midnight, I’m the road that found your door,
You’re the harbor in my weather, I’m the tide that comes ashore.
You’re the quilt of every story, I’m the thread that holds it tight,
You’re the ring that keeps a promise, I’m the vow that learns it right.

Pre-Chorus
If the years turn pages faster than our hands can turn them slow,
We’ll underline the quiet lines where only we will know.

Chorus
I’ll hold you steady as the light, when every shadow starts to bend,
I’ll be the compass in your night, pointing always home again.
Take my heart and take my name, let the stars sign what we write—
I’ll love you brave, I’ll love you plain,
I’ll love you steady as the light.

Verse 2
You’re the river mending counties, I’m the stone that lets you pass,
You’re the fire in winter’s window, I’m the breath upon the glass.
You’re the hymn I hum at daybreak, I’m the church of open skies,
You’re the field and I’m the rainfall, growing truth where promise lies.

Pre-Chorus
If the wind forgets our footprints and the map won’t say our names,
We’ll be lanterns over water, drawing shorelines out of flame.

Chorus
I’ll hold you steady as the light, when every shadow starts to bend,
You’ll be the compass in your night, pointing always home again.
Take my heart and take my name, let the stars sign what we write—
I’ll love you brave, I’ll love you plain,
I’ll love you steady as the light.

Bridge
If thunder finds our rooftop or the long days lean too hard,
We’ll be fence posts set in mercy, we’ll be fields that still bear stars.
Hand in hand, like oak and vine—what the weather can’t divide,
Every season, every mile, we’ll keep choosing side by side.

Chorus (Lift)
I’ll hold you steady as the light, when years go rushing out of frame,
I’ll be your quiet Saturday, your Sunday morning name.
Take my heart and take my name, let forever feel like right—
I’ll love you brave, I’ll love you plain,
I’ll love you steady as the light.

Tag
Here we are—two rivers one sight…
Lead me on, steady as the light.
