## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Got my truck parked in the drive
Tailgate down, feeling so alive
Blue jeans on and the sun's going down
Friday night in this little town
Cold beer waiting in the cooler ice
Got everything I need tonight

Chorus:
This is my front porch blessing
Cold drink and no stressing
Good friends and country music loud
Small town and I'm feeling proud
This is my front porch blessing
Life don't need no second guessing
Right here's where I belong
Front porch blessing all night long

Verse 2:
Bonfire crackling in the yard
Work week done, it ain't so hard
When you got a place to call your home
Never have to drink alone
Stars are shining way up high
This is how we get by

Chorus:
This is my front porch blessing
Cold drink and no stressing
Good friends and country music loud
Small town and I'm feeling proud
This is my front porch blessing
Life don't need no second guessing
Right here's where I belong
Front porch blessing all night long

Bridge:
Don't need no fancy city lights
Got everything here tonight
This old house and these old friends
Hoping this feeling never ends
Yeah, hoping this feeling never ends

Chorus:
This is my front porch blessing
Cold drink and no stressing
Good friends and country music loud
Small town and I'm feeling proud
This is my front porch blessing
Life don't need no second guessing
Right here's where I belong
Front porch blessing all night long
Front porch blessing all night long

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked intro), electric guitar (clean tone, subtle country twang), bass guitar (walking bass line), drums (simple backbeat with snare on 2 and 4), pedal steel guitar (subtle fills and solos). Key of G major. Tempo is upbeat but relaxed, aiming for a feel-good, singalong vibe. Vocals should be warm and sincere. The bridge should build slightly in intensity, leading into the final chorus. Consider adding a short guitar solo after the second chorus. The pedal steel should be prominent in the outro, fading out with the acoustic guitar. Use reverb and delay tastefully to create a sense of space and atmosphere. The song should evoke a feeling of warmth, contentment, and gratitude.
