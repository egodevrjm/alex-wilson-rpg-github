## Description
A heartfelt country anthem in 4/4 shuffle at 96 BPM, 'Folks Like Us' paints a vivid portrait of resilience and community spirit. Anchored by a walking upright bass, crisp brushed snare, and bright acoustic guitar, the song features signature twangy Telecaster licks, weeping steel guitar, and warm fiddle countermelodies. Alex Wilson's authentic Kentucky baritone delivers a raw, emotional performance, complemented by the comforting presence of an upright piano. It's a celebration of the unsung heroes who find strength in love, faith, and each other.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
We ain’t got gold, we ain’t got shine,
Just muddy boots and calloused time.
Our Sunday best is secondhand,
But we’ll lend it to you with a helping hand.

We patch up fences and old guitars,
Drive busted trucks with wishin’ stars.
We sing our pain, then pass the plate—
Don’t got much, but we give it straight.

(Chorus – Hook)
’Cause folks like us don’t quit, don’t fold,
We got fire in our bones and stories old.
Raise our voices like raisin’ barns—
Hold each other through the heavy storms.
We laugh, we cry, we cuss, we pray,
Fall down hard and get up anyway.
Ain’t fancy, but we’re strong and tough—
Built on love, yeah, folks like us.

(Verse 2)
You might hear hymns from a fiddle string,
Or find salvation in the way we sing.
Our dreams ride high on porchlight swings,
Where hope’s a bird with beat-up wings.

We show up when the world looks away,
Bring hot food when there’s hell to pay.
Ain’t in the news, ain’t in the gloss,
But we show up—and that’s the cost.

(Chorus – Hook)
Yeah, folks like us don’t quit, don’t fold,
We got fire in our bones and stories old.
Raise our voices like raisin’ barns—
Hold each other through the heavy storms.
We laugh, we cry, we cuss, we pray,
Fall down hard and get up anyway.
Ain’t perfect, but we’re full of trust—
Heart and grit, yeah, folks like us.

(Bridge)
We’ve been broke, but never empty.
Tired, but never done.
Love’s the only thing we spend,
And still got some.

(Guitar Solo - instrumental bridge, based on Telecaster and Steel guitar melodies)

(Final Chorus)
So here’s to the holler, to hands that heal,
To open doors and home-cooked meals.
To second chances, coffee cups—
Here’s to home… and folks like us.

(Outro)
Yeah, folks like us...built on love... folks like us...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Upright bass (walking bass line, emphasis on root and fifth), brushed snare (light shuffle feel), acoustic guitar (rhythm, strummed chords), Telecaster (twangy lead licks, pedal steel bends), steel guitar (countermelodies, atmospheric pads), fiddle (harmonizing melodies, occasional fills), upright piano (enters in later verses, adding warmth and fullness). Key: G Major. Tempo: 96 BPM (moderate shuffle). Feel: Rooted and authentic, genuine expression. Emphasis on storytelling through lyrical content and instrumental nuances. Vocal delivery should be raw and emotive. Backing vocals (harmonies) can be added on the choruses and bridge to enhance the sense of community and unity. Dynamics: Build dynamically through the verses to the choruses, release slightly in the bridge, build again to the final chorus. Consider a slight tempo increase during the outro to provide a sense of resolve.
