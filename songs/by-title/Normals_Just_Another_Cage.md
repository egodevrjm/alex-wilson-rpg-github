## Description
"Normal's Just Another Cage" is Alex Wilson's rebellious call to arms for anyone feeling stifled by the daily grind. This high-energy country-rock anthem captures the essence of freedom found in simple pleasures: good company, cold beer, and the promise of the open road. Wilson's gritty vocals, combined with relatable lyrics about escaping societal expectations, resonate deeply. The track blends a modern country sound with Southern rock influences, featuring driving rhythms, soaring guitars, and a touch of pedal steel. It's a celebration of individuality and living life on your own terms, tailor-made for Friday night singalongs and blasting out the speakers of a pickup truck.

## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Clocked out at five, same as every day
Boss man's talkin' 'bout that overtime pay
But I got plans that he don't understand
Got my truck, got my girl, got a cold beer in my hand
Radio's crankin', windows rolled down low
Leavin' all that nine-to-five behind, you know

Chorus:
Normal's just another cage
Ain't gonna live life on their stage
Tailgate down, Friday night
Blue jeans on and I feel alright
Normal's just another cage
I'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page
Tailgate down, Friday night
This is how I come alive

Verse 2:
They say settle down, buy a house with a fence
Work forty years, hope it all makes sense
But I'd rather be wild than safely contained
Life's too short to be living afraid
Got that fire in my soul, burnin' bright and free
Gonna chase the setting sun for all eternity

Chorus:
Normal's just another cage
Ain't gonna live life on their stage
Tailgate down, Friday night
Blue jeans on and I feel alright
Normal's just another cage
I'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page
Tailgate down, Friday night
This is how I come alive

Bridge:
So let 'em talk about their perfect plans
I'll take my chances right here where I stand
Freedom's callin' out my name so loud
I won't be locked up in their puppet crowd
Dirt road dust and a fiery sunset sky
That's where I feel like I can spread my wings and fly

Chorus:
Normal's just another cage
Ain't gonna live life on their stage
Tailgate down, Friday night
Blue jeans on and I feel alright
Normal's just another cage
I'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page
Tailgate down, Friday night
This is how I come alive
This is how I come alive

Outro:
Yeah, this is how I come alive (Guitar riff fades)
Friday night freedom, under these starry skies!


## Performance Notes

Tempo: Upbeat and driving, around 110 bpm. Aim for a steady, powerful feel.
Instrumentation: The song should open with a strong, slightly overdriven acoustic guitar riff. Drums enter powerfully with a driving backbeat. Electric guitars should be prominent, adding both rhythm and lead elements. The bass line should be locked in with the drums, creating a solid foundation. Use pedal steel guitar sparingly for texture, emotional swells, and fills, particularly in the bridge and instrumental break. Consider adding a Hammond organ swell underneath the chorus for added depth.
Vocals: Alex's vocals need to be raw and authentic, conveying both the frustration of being trapped and the exhilaration of freedom. Emphasize the grit and passion in his delivery.
Harmonies: Add simple but effective harmonies in the chorus, particularly on the higher notes, to create a fuller, anthemic sound. Use a call-and-response harmony on "Normal's just another cage".
Performance: Encourage crowd participation during the chorus, especially on the "Normal's just another cage" line. Get the audience clapping along to the beat during the verses. The song should build in energy throughout. The bridge should be dynamic, starting quieter and building to a powerful release back into the final chorus. Feature a guitar solo after the second chorus â€“ a bluesy, melodic solo that complements the song's theme of freedom. 
Structure: Add an instrumental break after the second chorus: four bars of guitar solo over the verse chords. The outro should fade out slowly with the guitar riff and ad-libs from Alex. Live, Alex can ad-lib over the outro: "Alright! Let's hear it!" or something similar to increase the energy. The song's raw energy makes it a perfect set opener or closer. Consider adding a slight delay effect to Alex's vocals on the outro.
Key: The key of G is well-suited to country-rock vocals and guitars.
