## Description
A high-octane outlaw country shuffle in E major, "Sheriff's Daughter" paints a vivid picture of rebellious romance. Driven by a relentless 128 BPM tempo, the song features a barrelhouse piano groove, biting Telecaster riffs, and a steady walking bass line. The snare drum shifts from brushes in the verses to sticks in the choruses, adding dynamic lift. Pedal steel guitar cries throughout the turnarounds and a sizzling fiddle doubles the main hook. Gang vocal shouts emphasize the chorus, with a final modulation upping the energy for a blazing finale. The lyrics tell the tale of a reckless love affair with the sheriff's daughter, a captivating hellraiser who embodies freedom and defiance.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She’s a wildfire in a leather jacket, county-line grin,
Sunday curls turned midnight wicked, trouble on ten.
Got a matchbook smile and a gasoline laugh,
Tattoo peeking like a secret under torn-up chaff.
She’s a grown woman, boots on the dash,
Twenty-one proof with a diamondback lash.
Says, “Boy, if you’re scared, then you’re not my kind,”
I said, “Hand me that fuse, let’s lose our minds.”

[Chorus]
Oh, the sheriff’s daughter—
Hotter than a summer on a pinewood altar.
Wild and free, kiss like a crime,
We light it up and watch it climb.
If loving her’s unlawful now,
Write me up and show me how.
Strike that spark and don’t back down—
Sheriff’s daughter, burn it all down.

[Verse 2]
She parks that smirk like a getaway car,
Moon in her hair, hips full of scars.
Says, “Rules are fences built for stray-lost men,”
Then she leans in close and I jump that pen.
She’s got outlaw honey on a rock-salt tongue,
Hands on my heart like a smoking gun.
Every “don’t” turns midnight gold,
When a rebel like that gets a heart to hold.

[Chorus]
Oh, the sheriff’s daughter—
Hotter than a summer on a pinewood altar.
Wild and free, kiss like a crime,
We light it up and watch it climb.
If loving her’s unlawful now,
Write me up and show me how.
Strike that spark and don’t back down—
Sheriff’s daughter, burn it all down.

[Bridge]
Blue lights bloom in the rearview glass,
But we’re two-step smoke in a field of match.
She laughs, “Baby, run,” and I lose my brakes—
Every siren’s just another backbeat quake.

[Verse 3]
She’s mercy at dawn with a knuckle-black grin,
Saint of the sinners, patron of sin.
Says, “Boy, the heart ain’t a courthouse door,”
Then signs my name with a little bit more.
If the good Lord’s watchin’, He’s tappin’ His boot,
To a heat-wave hymn and a hellfire flute.
We ain’t here for safe or sound,
We’re here to raise this nameless town.

[Final Chorus]
Oh, the sheriff’s daughter—
Hotter than a summer on a pinewood altar.
Wild and free, kiss like a crime,
We light it up and watch it climb.
If loving her’s unlawful now,
Write me up and show me how.
Strike that spark and don’t back down—
Sheriff’s daughter, burn it all down.

[Tag]
Badge on the dash, halo in flames—
Write our sins beneath our names.
Yeah, write our sins beneath our names.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Telecaster (clean, twangy tone with slight overdrive), barrelhouse piano (driving rhythm, bluesy fills), walking bass (upright or electric), drums (snappy snare with brush-to-stick transition), pedal steel (crying bends and fills), fiddle (doubling the vocal melody in sections). Tempo: 128 BPM. Key: E Major. Arrangement: Intro (piano, bass, drums establish groove), Verse 1 (vocals enter, Telecaster fills), Chorus (full band, gang vocals), Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge (drums become more prominent, build in intensity), Verse 3, Final Chorus (modulated up a whole step to F# Major), Tag (stripped-down arrangement, emphasizes the raw emotion). The song should have a raw, slightly unpolished feel, capturing the rebellious spirit of the lyrics. Consider adding a short instrumental break after the second chorus showcasing the fiddle and pedal steel.
