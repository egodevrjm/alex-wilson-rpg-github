# Rosie Walker — Sawdust & Satin (1965)

**Album Description:** A countrypolitan-steered debut. RCA tried to polish her into respectability, but her mountain grit bled through. Strings and studio polish meet front-porch honesty in a collection of songs about the girl who left the mountain, but couldn't leave the mountain behind.

## 1\) Mountain Boy Blues

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The city moon is a stranger’s dime, cold and hard and bright, It doesn’t know the whisper of a Pikeville county night. They taught me how to hold a fork and how to hide my drawl, But they never taught me how to stand when I begin to fall.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I got the mountain boy blues, in a town that shines with lies, Your hands were a hearth, now I’m cold in my shoes, And there’s a different kind of hunger in a Nashville sunrise. I’m just counting miles by the ache of the mountain boy blues.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] I saw a man in a tailored coat, he looked a bit like you, But his laugh was like a photograph, too perfect to be true. He never smelled of river mud or pine smoke in the rain, And holding him was just a way of speaking your name in vain.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I got the mountain boy blues, in a town that shines with lies, Your hands were a hearth, now I’m cold in my shoes, And there’s a different kind of hunger in a Nashville sunrise. I’m just counting miles by the ache of the mountain boy blues.


* **Musical Description** A slow 4/4 ballad dripping with Nashville A-Team polish. Weeping pedal steel carries the melody, with a bed of brushed snare and quiet upright bass. A tasteful string section swells under the chorus, trying to sweeten the heartache, but Rosie’s raw, homesick vocal keeps the mountain grit front and center.

## 2\) Secondhand Wedding Dress

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] In a pawnshop window, she was hanging like a ghost, A little yellowed at the seams from a promise someone lost. Fifty cents a yard for satin, traded for a meal, I bought her with a borrowed five and a heart that wouldn’t kneel.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] This ain’t a vow for him, it’s a promise to myself, To start again with nothing but my pride and threadbare health. I’ll wear the truth they couldn’t fit in lace, And walk a brand new aisle in this secondhand grace.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The stitches hold a story that I don’t need to know, Of some other woman’s garden where the roses didn’t grow. But in the mirror, I don’t see a future bought and sold, Just a woman tired of listening to the lies she’s always told.  
      
  * \[Bridge\] Maybe it’s not meant to be a gown of white and pure, Maybe it’s a battle flag for all that I’ve endured.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] This ain’t a vow for him, it’s a promise to myself, To start again with nothing but my pride and threadbare health. I’ll wear the truth they couldn’t fit in lace, And walk a brand new aisle in this secondhand grace.


* **Musical Description** A gentle 3/4 waltz. The arrangement is clean and classic countrypolitan, led by an acoustic guitar and a simple, melodic bass line. The pedal steel is more reflective than sad, and a small string quartet adds a touch of hopeful elegance, underscoring the theme of finding dignity in starting over.

## 3\) House That Listens

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] These four walls saw me pack my bags, these floorboards heard my doubt, The windowpane has memorized the face I show the town. The kitchen sink has washed away the taste of cheap red wine, And the bedroom door has closed upon a heart that wasn’t mine.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I can tell my secrets to the cracks along the wall, I can cry right at the ceiling, I can stumble, I can fall. This house don’t talk back, it don’t judge me for my sins, It just listens ’til I’m clean again.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The telephone can tell a lie, the mirror shows the strain, The letters that I never send are stacked beneath the rain. But the faucet drips a steady beat, a rhythm I can trust, And the settling of the timbers turns my worries into dust.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I can tell my secrets to the cracks along the wall, I can cry right at the ceiling, I can stumble, I can fall. This house don’t talk back, it don’t judge me for my sins, It just listens ’til I’m clean again.


* **Musical Description** An intimate, sparse performance. It’s just Rosie’s voice, close and confidential, and her fingerpicked Martin D-28 “Betty.” The production is dry and warm, with a touch of natural room reverb, making the listener feel like they are the fourth wall in her kitchen-table confessional.

## 4\) Little Church Steps

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] Mama’s hand was warm in mine, the preacher’s voice was stern, I kept my eyes down on my shoes and waited for my turn. Just a shy girl in a cotton dress, afraid to make a sound, Hiding in the shadows on that holy little ground.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] One step for forgiveness, two for finding grace, Three to lift my chin and let them see my face. I learned to climb by counting little church steps, And found the nerve to sing above the secrets that I’ve kept.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The porch was for the whispers, the pew was for the prayers, But the steps were for the choosing of the burdens that you bear. With every Sunday morning, I got a little taller, With every hymn I hummed, my voice got a little bolder.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] One step for forgiveness, two for finding grace, Three to lift my chin and let them see my face. I learned to climb by counting little church steps, And found the nerve to sing above the secrets that I’ve kept.


* **Musical Description** A mid-tempo song with a gentle, gospel-inflected feel. A simple, steady piano provides the foundation, complemented by upright bass and soft, brushed drums. The Jordanaires-style backing vocals add a reverent "hallelujah" harmony on the chorus, giving it a Sunday morning uplift.

## 5\) Bluebird After Midnight

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The sugar shaker’s sticky and the coffee’s turning cold, The last few lonely customers are looking tired and old. My fingers ache from pressing on these worn-out, weary strings, Playing for the ghosts of all the songs a jukebox never sings.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] The neon sign is humming a sad and flickering tune, Beneath a lonely, paper-pasted, cardboard-cutout moon. But I’ll trade another ballad for a dollar and a light, 'Cause if hope has hours, it's bluebird after midnight.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The waitress leans and listens with a rag in her tired hand, She knows about the promises they make in this strange land. She’ll give me one more coffee for the road I have to walk, A little bit of kindness on the other side of talk.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] The neon sign is humming a sad and flickering tune, Beneath a lonely, paper-pasted, cardboard-cutout moon. But I’ll trade another ballad for a dollar and a light, 'Cause if hope has hours, it's bluebird after midnight.


* **Musical Description** A smoky, late-night country-blues shuffle. A tremolo-heavy electric guitar sets the mood, weaving around a lazy upright bass line and the soft tap of a rimshot. Rosie’s vocal is weary but resilient, capturing the feeling of holding onto a dream when the whole world has gone to sleep.

## 6\) Ain’t No Fancy Lady

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] They want to put me in a dress that’s stitched up to the chin, Tell me how to curtsy, tell me where I should begin. They want to smooth my edges, they want to file my claws, And make me fit politely in their rulebook of applause.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I ain’t no fancy lady, I don’t pour no sweetened tea, My pearls are beads of sweat from singing in the key of me. You can keep your pretty polish and your high-society, I shine just fine without your chandelier.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] They say a woman’s place is knowing how to sweetly smile, And hide the truth behind her teeth and go the extra mile. But I was born for speaking up and singing out of turn, And that’s a lesson your good manners never seemed to learn.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I ain’t no fancy lady, I don’t pour no sweetened tea, My pearls are beads of sweat from singing in the key of me. You can keep your pretty polish and your high-society, I shine just fine without your chandelier.


* **Musical Description** An up-tempo, defiant shuffle that lets the grit show. A plucky Telecaster and a driving rhythm section give it a honky-tonk swagger. This is the least “countrypolitan” song on the album, a clear statement of intent. Rosie's vocal has a playful snarl, a preview of the outlaw to come.

## 7\) Sweet William’s Ghost (Traditional, early arrangement)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] Sweet William came at midnight’s door, Cold dew shining on the floor. “Rise up, rise up, my promised bride, For love has crossed the Great Divide.”  
      
  * \[Chorus\] Hush now, willow, bend and weep, Graveyard secrets do not sleep. Kiss me once and let me go, Back to the earth where wild winds blow.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] She laid her hand upon his chest, No heartbeat found, no mortal rest. “I kept your ribbon, red as sin, And all the vows we made back then.”  
      
  * \[Verse 3\] “Go on, Sweet Will, to the other side, I’ll plant your name where roses hide. And if I sing on Sunday morn, Know grief made grace where love was torn.”


* **Musical Description** A tender, porch-lit folk arrangement. Rosie’s pure vocal is accompanied by her gentle clawhammer banjo and a mournful, softly bowed fiddle. There are no drums, only the quiet pulse of the instruments. It feels less like a gothic horror story and more like a deeply sad, intimate farewell between two lovers separated by death.

---

## 8\) Kitchen Radio

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] Sunrise through the window, bacon in the pan, News about the weather from a far-off radio man. Mama’s humming softly as she mends a cotton seam, Living out a simple life, holding on to a dream.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] We didn’t have much money, but we had the Grand Ole Opry, Singing right along with all the ghosts and all the glories. Turn that kitchen radio up, Mama’s thread is in the tune, Stitching us together underneath a faded afternoon.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] Daddy’d come in tired, with coal dust on his face, He’d wash up at the sink and find his quiet resting place. He’d listen to the headlines and the price of corn and grain, And the music was the only thing that washed away the stain.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] We didn’t have much money, but we had the Grand Ole Opry, Singing right along with all the ghosts and all the glories. Turn that kitchen radio up, Mama’s thread is in the tune, Stitching us together underneath a faded afternoon.


* **Musical Description** Warm and nostalgic, this is pure, classic country. A gently strummed acoustic guitar, a simple and melodic pedal steel part that never gets in the way of the story, and a warm, affectionate vocal from Rosie. The production feels like a fond memory.

## 9\) Hickory Chair Waltz

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The needle drops and the music starts to play, I close my eyes and drift a year away. I take your hand though there’s nobody there, And pull you from that empty hickory chair.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] And we dance around the kitchen in the pale and lonely light, To a song that keeps a memory from giving up the fight. The floorboards creak a rhythm, a sad and sweet affair, Leave the record on, this hickory holds me up, I swear.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The neighbors think I’m crazy, and maybe they are right, To spend my time slow dancing with a ghost here every night. But they don’t know how heavy a quiet evening falls, When your shadow is the only thing that answers when I call.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] And we dance around the kitchen in the pale and lonely light, To a song that keeps a memory from giving up the fight. The floorboards creak a rhythm, a sad and sweet affair, Leave the record on, this hickory holds me up, I swear.


* **Musical Description** A classic, heartbreaking 3/4 country waltz. A lone fiddle plays the sorrowful main melody, answered by weeping pedal steel. The rhythm section is spare and gentle, just enough to keep the dance moving. Rosie’s voice is fragile, cracking with emotion on the final chorus.

## 10\) Coal Train Lullaby

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The moon is just a sliver on the blacktop of the sky, The mountain holds its breath and waits to hear the night go by. Another shift is over, another day is done, And all the heavy work is through for my own little one.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] Can you hear that whistle moaning, a lonely, rumbling sigh? That’s just the sound of morning getting closer in the sky. So close your eyes, my darling, don’t you worry, don’t you fret, Sleep, little light, while the coal train hums, the night’s not over yet.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] That engine’s pulling promises and taking dreams away, But it always brings your daddy home at the closing of the day. It sings a song of iron, a song of smoke and steam, A rhythm for the valley, and a cradle for your dream.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] Can you hear that whistle moaning, a lonely, rumbling sigh? That’s just the sound of morning getting closer in the sky. So close your eyes, my darling, don’t you worry, don’t you fret, Sleep, little light, while the coal train hums, the night’s not over yet.


* **Musical Description** A gentle lullaby with a cradle-rock 6/8 rhythm. The arrangement is built around Rosie’s fingerpicked acoustic guitar and the soft, deep drone of a cello. There’s a touch of accordion adding a warm, breathy texture. Her vocal is a tender, loving whisper.

---

## 11\) Front-Porch Prayer

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The crickets are a choir tonight, the stars are gospel bright, And I’m sitting on this splintered wood beneath a yellow light. I haven’t been to church in weeks, my hymnal’s gathering dust, I’ve been putting all my faith in things that turn to rust.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I ain’t asking for a miracle, I ain’t asking to be saved, Just for a little quiet for the wild heart you gave. I’m half a verse from heaven and the porch light’s low, And I’m hoping you can hear me on your holy radio.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] I’ve got my doubts and questions, I’ve got my share of sin, I’ve been knocking on the wrong doors, hoping they would let me in. But out here in the stillness, where the night is deep and wide, There’s nowhere left to run to, and nothing left to hide.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] I ain’t asking for a miracle, I ain’t asking to be saved, Just for a little quiet for the wild heart you gave. I’m half a verse from heaven and the porch light’s low, And I’m hoping you can hear me on your holy radio.


* **Musical Description** Extremely sparse and quiet. The only sounds are Rosie’s voice and her acoustic guitar, recorded with enough space to hear her fingers on the frets and the soft night sounds of crickets faintly in the background. It is a moment of pure, unvarnished confession.

## 12\) Neon Don’t Know My Name

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] They put my picture in the paper, a girl I barely know, Smiling under headlines about the seeds I’m trying to sow. They call me up and coming, they call me fresh and new, They talk about the records, but they haven’t got a clue.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] 'Cause out here on the sidewalk, I’m just another face, Lost between the music and this unfamiliar place. I’m singing for my supper, playing out my hand, And the neon don’t know my name in this promised land.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] They want to know my story, so I give them what they want, A fairytale from the mountains, a girl who’s brave and strong. But I leave out all the hungry nights, the doubt that sticks like glue, The fear that I’m just one song short of ever breaking through.  
      
  * \[Bridge\] But I hear a different promise in the hum of this guitar, It’s gonna write my future in the embers of a star.  
      
  * \[Final Chorus\] And one day on that marquee, they’ll see it up in lights, Shining through the memory of these long and lonely nights. I’ll pay my dues and take my chance, and make my final stand, They’ll spell me right when the neon learns my name in this promised land.


* **Musical Description** The most polished production on the album, hinting at Rosie’s future. It’s a mid-tempo, forward-driving song with a full band arrangement: a clean electric guitar melody, walking bass, and a confident snare beat. The strings are here not for sadness, but for ambition, lifting the final chorus as Rosie makes her determined vow. It’s the perfect closer, a bridge from the girl she was to the star she is about to become.

# Rosie Walker — *Baptized in Bourbon* (1968)

## 1\) Baptized in Bourbon

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
I was born where the creek runs black with rain,  
Granddad’s jar on the mantle like a saint with no name.  
Mama said “child, don’t you chase that fire,”  
But a neon cross called me higher and higher.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I got baptized in bourbon, choir of barroom souls,  
Hallelujahs off a jukebox, mercy in a fishbowl.  
If there’s grace in the bottom, I’ll find it again,  
Washed in 90 proof water, forgiven of men.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Preacher said “girl, there’s a right and a wrong,”  
But I heard steel strings preaching better in song.  
I knelt on sawdust, stained with last night’s sin,  
And rose with a tremble and a red-lipped grin.

**\[Bridge\]**  
If heaven won’t have me for the life that I chose,  
Then I’ll camp by the doorway till the last call closes.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I got baptized in bourbon, choir of barroom souls,  
Hallelujahs off a jukebox, mercy in a fishbowl.  
If there’s grace in the bottom, I’ll find it again,  
Washed in 90 proof water, forgiven of men.

**\[Tag\]**  
Pour me an amen, let the spirits descend.

### **Musical description**

A mid-tempo barroom waltz in 3/4 with acoustic guitar and walking upright bass, framed by fiddle lines and soft snare brushes. Pedal steel answers the vocal phrases; a brief tremolo electric adds shimmer in the bridge. The mix is warm and live, like a mic in a tiny honky-tonk room.

### **Thematic overview**

An outlaw redemption hymn: sin and salvation meet under neon. Think the piety-meets-honky-tonk tension of classic country gospel, sung with the grit of early outlaw storytellers.

## **2\) Mountain Boy Blues**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Blackberry thorns on my Sunday dress,  
Your kiss tasted like river and red clay mess.  
You swore that the ridgeline could hold our names,  
But the bus took me south on a road with flames.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I got the mountain boy blues,  
In a town that polishes truth.  
Your hands were a hearth, now I’m cold in my shoes,  
Counting miles by the ache of the mountain boy blues.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
You fixed a porch step with a nail and a prayer,  
Said, “Girl, I’ll be waiting in that hickory chair.”  
But city lights barter in pretty lies,  
And I learned how a promise in daylight dies.

**\[Bridge\]**  
If I ever come back with my name worn thin,  
Will you open that door like you did back then?

**\[Chorus\]**  
I got the mountain boy blues…  
Your hands were a hearth, now I’m cold in my shoes.  
All I own is a voice and a pair of bad news—  
And the long lonesome moan of the mountain boy blues.

### **Musical description**

Slow 4/4 ballad with fingerpicked guitar and bowed fiddle; spare percussion enters only in the second verse. Pedal steel drapes sustained chords; a brushed tom heartbeat underscores the bridge. Intimate, breath-close vocal.

### **Thematic overview**

A leaving-home lament where ambition costs a first love. The ache recalls mountain ballads filtered through Nashville lights—part porch-swing confession, part stage-door regret.

## **3\) Red Dress Revenge**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
You left your cologne and a lipstick lie,  
Two-timing shadow in a suit and tie.  
I stitched my temper into scarlet thread,  
Hemmed it high so you can watch me tread.

**\[Chorus\]**  
This is red dress revenge—  
Click of the heel, cut of the fringe.  
Spin on a dime ‘til your pride unhinges,  
Baby, watch these ruby-stitched hinges.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Took your records, left your sorry ring,  
Kept the rhythm, threw out the king.  
Bartender winked when I paid my tab,  
Said, “Girl, that color sure knows how to stab.”

**\[Bridge\]**  
You taught me the step—now I’ll lead the dance,  
Turn every sideways look to a second chance.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Red dress revenge—  
Every eye’s a jury bench.  
Verdict’s in, with a sway and a flinch,  
Case closed, by an inch of red dress revenge.

**\[Tag\]**  
Try to kiss this goodbye—if you can catch me.

### **Musical description**

Up-tempo 2-step with twangy electric riffing, slap-back echo on snare, and handclap accents. Fiddle saws a hot counter-melody; baritone guitar doubles the bass hook. The vocal rides playful and cutting, with stacked harmonies on the title line.

### **Thematic overview**

A sassy, self-liberating kiss-off that turns heartbreak into spectacle. Imagine honky-tonk fire with pop-smart hooks—swaggering like an early feminist barn-burner.

## **4\) Daddy’s Pistol**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
He came home mean with a jaw full of lies,  
Whiskey-thick breath and Sunday-school eyes.  
Said, “Girl, you belong to the back of the line,”  
But I learned to aim between prayers and time.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Daddy’s pistol in a flour-sack wrap,  
Heavy as memory, cold as a slap.  
Twelve steps from the door to the gate of hell,  
One click, one mercy, one midnight bell.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Neighbors said hush, keep the windows closed,  
But the bruises kept tally like winter crows.  
Moon on the table, shining clean and plain,  
I traded the thunder for a world without pain.

**\[Bridge\]**  
Judge, I ain’t asking for a saint’s white veil,  
Just a quiet night’s sleep and a postmarked bail.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Daddy’s pistol in a flour-sack wrap…  
If silence is golden, then justice is black.  
I’ll carry the echo where the angels dwell,  
One click, one mercy, one midnight bell.

**\[Tag\]**  
Some sins end with the pulling of a thread.

### **Musical description**

Minor-key murder ballad; brushed snare and floor tom pulse like distant boots. Dobro and low fiddle drone create a graveyard hush; a reverb-bare vocal tells it plain. No solos—just a chilling, restrained crescendo into the final chorus.

### **Thematic overview**

A stark self-defense narrative that radio won’t touch. It’s Appalachian noir—somewhere between a courthouse whisper and a mountain hymn.

---

## **5\) Highway Honey**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Chrome on the sunrise, diesel in my hair,  
Lines on the blacktop like a sinner’s prayer.  
Dispatch calls me “darlin’” through the static fray,  
I call myself “free” ‘cause I live this way.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I’m a highway honey, shiftin’ through the dark,  
Coffee in my veins and a map in my heart.  
Miles in my marrow, wind in my lungs,  
Taillight halos and asphalt tongues.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Rest stop roses wilting in a glass,  
Love’s a tollbooth—sometimes you pass.  
But I carry a picture of a sky-wide home,  
Tape on the edges where the corners are worn.

**\[Bridge\]**  
Breaker one-nine, if you hear my song,  
Slide me a “ten-four” and I’ll roll along.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I’m a highway honey…  
Gear teeth singing like a Sunday choir.  
If you’re chasing a dream, I got an open wire.

**\[Tag\]**  
Catch me between the white lines and the dawn.

### **Musical description**

Chugging 4/4 road groove; tic-tac bass doubles upright for that rubber-on-asphalt feel. Clean electric plays freight-train triads, with harmonica fills as mile-markers. The chorus widens into stacked harmonies that feel wind-blown.

### **Thematic overview**

A long-haul freedom song told from behind the wheel—rest stops, radios, and restless hearts. Tonally it nods to classic trucker anthems with a woman’s grit and velocity.

---

## **6\) Coal Dust Memories**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Daddy coughed thunder into a crumpled rag,  
Black like the inside of a county flag.  
Mama hung wash where the mountain leans,  
Snow of white sheets, night of black seams.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Coal dust memories, settle when I sing,  
Lay on my lashes like a winter wing.  
Every breath a ledger, every shift a prayer,  
We dug out a life from a lonesome stair.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Payday script and a stove that moaned,  
Tin roof storms when the holler groaned.  
We learned our hymns from the mine’s low whine,  
And swore our names to the county line.

**\[Bridge\]**  
If the canary’s crying in a rusted cage,  
I’ll carry its song to another page.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Coal dust memories…  
If I shine at all, it’s from under the ground—  
A diamond of sorrow that the nightman found.

### **Musical description**

Loping 6/8 with fingerpicked guitar and bowed cello beneath the fiddle—earthy, hymn-like. A pump-organ colors the choruses; snare brushes mimic soft shovel strokes. Dynamic lift on the bridge, then a hushed final refrain.

### **Thematic overview**

A love letter and lament for mining-town bloodlines. It blends front-porch folk with elegiac country, equal parts soot and halo.

---

## **7\) Broken Bottle Blues**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Barback sweeping up a Saturday war,  
Glass like stars on a sticky floor.  
I’m nursing a truth I can’t afford,  
Counting the lies that I once adored.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I got the broken bottle blues,  
Cut my lips on yesterday’s news.  
If loving you’s a tab I’ll never lose,  
Pour me silence—no more dues.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Jukebox mercy for a quarter’s sin,  
Your ghost sits down where my nerves wear thin.  
The mirror behind the bottles tells it plain—  
I’m the last girl slow dancing with pain.

**\[Bridge\]**  
Turn out the neon, let the shadow preach,  
Some kinds of heaven are too high to reach.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Broken bottle blues…  
I’ll tip the night and pay the truth—  
Then walk home barefoot from these shoes.

### **Musical description**

Slow, raw shuffle with rim-click drums and swampy tremolo guitar. Harmonica moans between vocal lines; upright bass slurs into notes for a woozy sway. The vocal is intimate, mic-kissing, with a gritty overdrive only in the peaks.

### **Thematic overview**

Heartbreak without polish—just shards and skin. Blues-bitten country that staggers, stands, and sings anyway.

## **8\) Sweet William’s Ghost (Traditional, rearranged)**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Sweet William came at midnight’s door,  
Cold dew shining on the floor.  
“Rise up, rise up, my promised bride,  
For love has crossed the Great Divide.”

**\[Chorus\]**  
Hush now, willow, bend and weep,  
Graveyard secrets do not sleep.  
Kiss me once and let me go,  
Back to the earth where wild winds blow.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
“I kept your ribbon, red as sin,  
Buried it deep beneath my skin.  
But vows we broke must now be mended,  
Or chains will drag where roads have ended.”

**\[Bridge\]**  
She laid her hand upon his chest—  
No heartbeat found, no mortal rest.

**\[Verse 3\]**  
“Go on, Sweet Will, to the other side,  
I’ll plant your name where roses hide.  
And if I sing on Sunday morn,  
Know grief made grace where love was torn.”

**\[Chorus\]**  
Hush now, willow, bend and weep…  
I’ll meet you where the mountains keep—  
A ring of stone, a field of snow.

### **Musical description**

Modal mountain setting in Dorian, clawhammer banjo leading with droned fiddle and low harmony voices. No kit—just foot-stomp pulse and a mournful bowed bass. The melody keeps a centuries-old feel while the chorus adds Rosie’s modern cadence.

### **Thematic overview**

A gothic mountain ballad of vows beyond the grave. It threads ancient Appalachian lament through a contemporary cadence—old bones, new blood.

## **9\) Nashville Prisoner**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Golden door with a paper crown,  
Smiling men who write your sound.  
They sweeten the coffee, salt the deal,  
Then tally your soul by how it feels.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I’m a Nashville prisoner, dressed in rhinestone stripes,  
Doing time in key of compromise.  
Trade your name for a chorus that bites—  
Parole denied if you sing your life.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
They said, “Be sweet, shorten the knife,”  
“Smile on cue, don’t live a life.”  
I walked out mid-song with a broken grin,  
Left a note: “Contract’s done—truth walks in.”

**\[Bridge\]**  
If freedom’s a verse that won’t test well,  
I’ll busk my confession at the gates of hell.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I’m a Nashville prisoner…  
Unlock the booth, kill the lights—  
I’ll take my sentence out into the night.

### **Musical description**

Hard-charging country shuffle with snarling Tele rhythm, baritone guitar hook, and fiddle in unison stabs. Kick and snare punch like a train; brief half-time breakdown in the bridge. Lead vocal is sharp, unsugared, almost spitting consonants.

### **Thematic overview**

A bitter industry broadside—barbed, funny, furious. It rings like early renegade country meeting bar-band rock momentum.

## **10\) Sunday Morning Sinner**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Smell of frying bacon and miracle cream,  
Radio choir in a sunbeam stream.  
I lace my boots with a shaking hand,  
Try not to tremble when the hymns all land.

**\[Chorus\]**  
I’m a Sunday morning sinner with a Saturday tongue,  
A heart full of mercy that keeps coming undone.  
If heaven keeps score, let it count my try,  
I’ll sit in the back and still aim high.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
The pew is hard as a truth I owe,  
I nod at the preacher like he don’t know.  
But the woman I was ‘neath a neon sign  
Still bows her head when the lilies shine.

**\[Bridge\]**  
If grace is a well you find in thirst,  
I’ll drink what I can and forgive the worst.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Sunday morning sinner…  
Give me a chorus I can sing without shame—  
And a life I can live with my own name.

**\[Tag\]**  
Amen in denim, and I’ll try again.

### **Musical description**

Gospel-tinted country in mid-tempo 4/4 with piano triplets, brushed kit, and harmony quartet in the final chorus. Pedal steel swells like an organ; handclaps sneak in on the bridge. The production stays earthy—church by way of kitchen table.

### **Thematic overview**

A confession of the everyday backslider: tender, unvarnished, hopeful. It blends honky-tonk honesty with Sunday-service uplift—think barroom benedictions sung by a rebel choir.

---

### **Album notes**

*Baptized in Bourbon* introduces Rosie’s outlaw creed—tough as boot leather, tender as an old hymn—mixing barroom sacrament, mountain folklore, truck-stop freedom, and industry defiance, just as her early Nashville legend suggests. It’s the sound of a woman who refused to bleach her hair, wore pants on the Opry stage, and sang the truth even when it bit back.

# Rosie Walker — *Good Girls Go to Heaven* (1970)

## 1\) Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go to Nashville)   

Lyrics    
\[Intro \- Sassy guitar lick in G with prominent bass line\]  
\[Verse 1\]  
Good girls marry doctors, teachers, and preachers  
Bad girls write songs and become features  
Good girls wear white on their wedding day  
Bad girls wear rhinestones and make the men pay  
\[Verse 2\]  
Good girls stay home cooking supper at five  
Bad girls play the Ryman on Saturday night  
Good girls keep quiet when the men folk talk  
Bad girls grab the microphone and walk the walk  
\[Chorus\]  
Good girls go to heaven with their virtue intact  
Bad girls go to Nashville and never look back  
Saint Peter’s got a list but honey, I don’t care  
‘Cause all the best parties ain’t happening up there  
Good girls go to heaven, it’s a well-known fact  
But bad girls go to Nashville, and that’s where the action’s at  
\[Bridge \- Electric guitar solo with attitude\]  
\[Verse 3\]  
My mama cried when I packed my guitar  
Said “Rosie, that city will leave you with scars”  
But I’d rather have scars than a perfect reputation  
I’m building my own kind of salvation  
\[Final Chorus with spoken word outro\]  
Good girls go to heaven, bless their hearts  
Bad girls go to Nashville and top the charts  
(Spoken) And when my time comes, I’ll take the elevator going down  
‘Cause all my friends will be there, and we’re gonna paint that town

### Musical description

Swaggering 60s Nashville bad-girl country in bright G major: twangy electric lead, walking bass, snappy snare with slap-back, and call-and-response gang shouts on the final hook. Brief guitar solo burns with attitude; Rosie’s vocal is sly and defiant, mixed hot and dry.

### **Thematic overview**

A rhinestone-flashing manifesto that crowns independence over respectability—pure bar-room liberation. Think the wink and bite of 60s honky-tonk with early outlaw grit.

# **2\) Magdalena’s Garden**

### **Lyrics**

\[Intro \- Acoustic guitar and pedal steel in D\]

\[Verse 1\]

Down beside the railroad where the coal trains rattle by

Magdalene tends her garden where the good folks don't pry

She's got flowers blooming pretty in the lamplight after dark

Tending to their petals with a mother's careful heart

\[Verse 2\]

Each one came here broken from some trouble down the line

The youngest just sixteen when her papa crossed that line

Now they bloom together in the house beside the mine

Where Magdalene keeps watch over her garden all the time

\[Chorus\]

When the evening callers come to see her flowers bloom

She makes sure they're gentle in those upstairs rooms

These are night-time flowers that need special care

In Magdalene's garden at the top of the stairs

\[Verse 3\]

When the winter frost comes creeping and threatens all her flowers

She keeps the house warm and guards them through the dangerous hours

When the money river runs dry in the summer heat

She finds ways to water them and keep them on their feet

\[Bridge \- Pedal steel solo over D-G-D-A-D\]

\[Verse 4\]

Once she was somebody's flower in another place

Till she saved enough to buy her own little space

Now she grows a garden for the girls who got no home

Gives them shelter and protection so they're never quite alone

\[Verse 5\]

The church folks whisper stories, the wives all turn away

But when trouble finds their daughters, it's Magdalene's where they stay

She don't plant no seeds that might grow where they shouldn't grow

Just tends her special garden with the kindness that she knows

\[Final Chorus\]

When the evening callers come to see her flowers bloom

She keeps careful watching over every room

These are night-time flowers that the daylight makes afraid

In Magdalene's garden where the lost girls find their trade

\[Outro \- Acoustic guitar and pedal steel fade\]

### **Musical description**

Mystic minor-key 6/8 with clawhammer banjo, droning fiddle, and brushed toms like thunder underfoot. Dobro harmonics sparkle like “bottle-tree” light; vocal sits close and hushed, blooming to belt in the chorus.

### **Thematic overview**

A mountain-gothic fable about a wise woman who heals what church and doctors won’t. Sonically it lives where front-porch folk meets swampy country noir.

# **3\) Leather and Lace Lies**

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
They sell you virtue by the yard, stitch it tight and pale,  
Tell me I should whisper sweet while they get full of ale.  
You want a lady in the daylight, devil after dark—  
Funny how your halo shrinks when I leave just a spark.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Leather and lace lies—boys like yours were born to buy,  
Preach it in a Sunday suit, break it in a tie.  
You can pin me to your story, bend me to your size,  
But I will not wear your leather and lace lies.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
You measure worth by wedding veils and who keeps score at night,  
But I make vows to my guitar and keep ‘em when I write.  
If “good” means never speaking up, you’ll have to go without—  
I learned the truth has sharper teeth than any hand-me-down doubt.

**\[Bridge\]**  
I’ll hem my skirt with freedom thread, and let the seam rip grin—  
The fit is mine, the change is mine, and so’s this pretty sin.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Leather and lace lies… take your label, take your prize—  
I’ll take the stage and split your alibis.

### **Musical description**

Hard 2-step stomp: Telecaster bite, baritone guitar doubling the bass, fiddle in tight stabs, and a half-time snare drop into the bridge. Rosie’s phrasing is percussive and smirking; gang “hey\!”s spark the last chorus.

### **Thematic overview**

Tears the bow off double standards with a grin and a growl. A feminist honky-tonk hammer wrapped in rhinestone.

---

## 4\) Copperhead Road (Her Version)

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Granddad’s mash in a buried still, creek fog thick as thieves,  
Copper line hums like a rattler’s hymn through laurel-hidden leaves.  
Sheriff’s boy plays church on Sunday, hunts us come the night—  
We run that mountain lightning by the glow of ghostly light.

**\[Chorus\]**  
On Copperhead Road, the law don’t know my name,  
Boot prints fade where the whip-poor-wills proclaim.  
Moon in a Mason jar, mercy in a load—  
I learned to fly low down Copperhead Road.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Mama kept the ledger neat in pie-crust calendar squares,  
I learned the math of hunger—profit, risk, and prayers.  
If you call it sin to feed the holler through a drought,  
Then bless me with a better law and I’ll come walking out.

**\[Bridge\]**  
Headlights like a serpent’s eye—cut and kill the beams,  
Shift to second, sing a psalm, and slide between the pines.

**\[Chorus\]**  
On Copperhead Road… where the ridge keeps code,  
I carry family thunder in a backroads ode.

**\[Tag\]**  
Clink a jar and say amen—survival ain’t a crime.

### **Musical description**

Steam-engine backbeat with hand-drum thumps, octave-down tic-tac bass, and a droning fiddle that saws like tires on gravel. Resonator guitar riffs in unison with the vocal hook; last chorus modulates up a half-step for a jailbreak feel.

### **Thematic overview**

A moonrunner’s catechism—family, hunger, and defiance. Sound blends bootleg folk with road-war country drive.

## 5\) The Ballad of Lucy Jordan — *cover (lyric excerpt \+ arrangement only)*

*Sorry—can’t provide full lyrics to a copyrighted song. Here’s a brief, under-90-character excerpt quoted for reference and the rest as summary.*  
**Excerpt (under 90 characters):** “At the age of thirty-seven she realized she’d never ride / through Paris…”

### **Rosie’s arrangement & lyrical angle (summary)**

Rosie slows the tempo to a dusk-lit 6/8 and reframes Lucy not as a tragic surrender but a flinty dreamer who reclaims the wheel in the last verse—turning the fade into ignition. She adds a short spoken aside at the bridge, a dry, compassionate monologue to Lucy, before the final lift.

### **Musical description**

Wurlitzer piano and pedal steel braid together; low harmony trio hums like streetlights. A brushed snare heartbeat, tremolo guitar lanterns, and a key-change coda deliver a quietly towering finale.

### **Thematic overview**

A woman’s private rebellion sung with tender steel—resilience in a rear-view mirror. Emotionally lands between confessional Nashville balladry and cinematic Americana ache.

---

## 6\) Devil’s Backbone

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Switchback spine on a mountain grade,  
Rain like nails and the guardrails frayed.  
He said “Hold tight, darlin’, I know this ridge,”  
But pride don’t brake on a one-lane bridge.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Devil’s Backbone—eat your prayers and spit ‘em chrome,  
Ghosts in the gravel sing “don’t go home.”  
If a man won’t bend, that road will break his bones—  
I’ve seen love roll off the Devil’s Backbone.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
He chased the curve like it owed him debt,  
I counted crosses where the taillights set.  
I took the wheel with a jaw like flint,  
Said, “Boy, your last chance already went.”

**\[Bridge\]**  
Some learn slow what the mountain knows—  
Live soft, steer steady, or the ridge will close.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Devil’s Backbone… I’ll take the valley’s calm,  
Let thunder keep the men who need its psalm.

### **Musical description**

Driving minor-key shuffle with floor-tom “tire” pattern, tremolo baritone hook, and twin-fiddle riffs that skid and squeal. Final chorus hits double-time, then cuts to a single, ringing low-E like a brake at the cliff.

### **Thematic overview**

A cautionary asphalt psalm about toxic bravado and the roads that punish it. Muscle, menace, and mountain weather in one fast lane.

---

## 7\) Cherokee Rose

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Grandma’s hands were thunderbirds, lines of storm and grace,  
Braided stories in my hair and cedar on the lace.  
She said, “Carry what they stole, but don’t let sorrow win—  
Wear your name like sunrise on the red earth of your skin.”

**\[Chorus\]**  
Cherokee Rose, bloom fierce through wire and frost,  
Teach this wandering heart what our mothers never lost.  
If they paved our path with silence, we will sing it into stone,  
Cherokee Rose—make a country of our own.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Agents came with paper knives and smiles like winter teeth,  
We kept language in our humming and our prayers beneath.  
Grandma pinned a rose to my black-jeans stage,  
Said, “Girl, let your roots be louder than their cage.”

**\[Bridge\]**  
I plant a song where borders run, a blossom in the seam—  
The petal is a memory, the thorn a right to dream.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Cherokee Rose… bloom hot in radio chrome—  
Wherever I am singing, I am coming home.

### **Musical description**

Lyrical 4/4 in bright A major; fiddle sings the rose motif, pedal steel answers like wind through pines. Light toms and hand drum add earth-pulse; harmonies blossom to a wordless “oh-oh” coda.

### **Thematic overview**

An honoring of her grandmother’s heritage and resilience, claimed in public and sung in private. Rooted pride braided with modern honky-tonk—Rosie’s lineage worn like a flower on a black shirt.

## 8\) Lipstick Letters

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Found a tube in the glovebox—ruby named “Adieu,”  
So I wrote my better endings on a bathroom mirror’s dew.  
“Dear Bobby, keep the Chevy, she prefers to break with you—  
Dear Allen, call your mama, tell her I returned her view.”

**\[Chorus\]**  
Lipstick letters—scarlet on the glass,  
Kisses for the parting and a prayer for what won’t last.  
I sign ‘em with a flourish, seal ‘em with a grin,  
A smudge of sweet forgiveness and a promise not to sin.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
“Dear Danny, take the records, I’ll take back my name—  
Dear world, I’m done rehearsing for your second-billing game.”  
The sink runs like a river, carries off the red,  
But every curve I drew tonight is inked inside my head.

**\[Bridge\]**  
Love is just a postcard when the postman sleeps till noon—  
Write it quick and send it off before it turns to ruin.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Lipstick letters… artful little scars—  
I’ll hang ‘em in a gallery of heart-broke bars.

### **Musical description**

Playful mid-tempo shuffle with piano triplets and snare on 2/4 “hip sway.” Telecaster chicken-picks around a sly walking bass; backing vocals ooh in 60s girl-group sparkle on the choruses.

### **Thematic overview**

Witty, flirty farewells written in red—agency with a flourish. A hooky pop-country wink inside a honky-tonk frame.

---

## 9\) Moonshine Mama

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
She ties her hair in kerchief black, the creek runs quiet and low,  
Copper sings, the thermometer blinks—a secret fire’s glow.  
Baby on her hip some nights, ledger in her head,  
Counting jars and counting stars and who gets milk and bread.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Moonshine mama—saint of busted times,  
Turns sugar into supper with her bootleg rhymes.  
If lawmen ask ‘bout blessings poured from mason light,  
She says, “I tithe in overtime and sleep all right.”

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Church folk sip on Saturday then smile on Sunday’s pew,  
She sells them thunder by the quart and mercy by the two.  
If you call it sin to keep the pantry fed and warm,  
Then bring a better miracle—I’ll lay down my still at dawn.

**\[Bridge\]**  
When winter knocks like a debt-collector’s fist,  
She fills the jars with summer’s sun and steam-kissed risk.

**\[Chorus\]**  
Moonshine mama… I learned my math from you—  
How survival turns to music when the copper sings true.

### **Musical description**

Front-porch boogie in E with handclaps, stomp box, and jubilant fiddle. Harmonica trades 4s with resonator; final chorus stacks a jubilant holler-choir for a barn-dance finish.

### **Thematic overview**

A celebration of outlaw caretaking—illicit labor as love and survival. Joyous and unsorry, like a kitchen table become a stage.

---

## 10\) When the Man Comes Around

### **Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Sirens in the wheatfield, ash on Sunday coats,  
Locusts in the hymnals, thunder in our throats.  
I’ve been tallying my grievances, my alibis and charms,  
But the ledger starts at zero when the trumpet hits the farms.

**\[Chorus\]**  
When the Man comes around, hold your breath and stand your ground,  
Lay your liquor at the door, lay your secrets on the sound.  
If your Pretty-Good was gospel, you’ll be naked at the line—  
When the Man comes around, may the mercy be mine.

**\[Verse 2\]**  
I’ve danced in neon baptisms, I’ve kissed with Sunday guilt,  
I’ve hammered truth to melodies and sold them for a quilt.  
If judgment rides a pale horse through this courthouse of a town,  
I’ll tip my hat and tell him what I built when I fell down.

**\[Bridge\]**  
If grace is just a rumor, let it still be said  
I sang it like a lifeline thrown to all the nearly-dead.

**\[Chorus\]**  
When the Man comes around… if I fail the holy test,  
I’ll trade a crown for one more song and try to do the rest.

**\[Tag\]**  
Amen for the sinners—may we stumble into light.

### **Musical description**

Apocalyptic country-gospel in rolling 12/8: pump-organ pads, tom-drum thunder, and a choir that swells from murmured oohs to full shout. Pedal steel peals like a bell; the final chorus modulates and drops the band on the last “amen.”

### **Thematic overview**

An end-times benediction from a honky-tonk pulpit—reckoning without self-pity. It marries barroom confession with tent-revival thunder for a cinematic closer.

# Rosie Walker — Non-Album Singles (1963-1972)

---

## 1\) Whiskey Lullaby Blues (1963)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The sheriff’s car crawled past the house, its headlights thick with rain, I pulled the curtain tighter, tried to swallow down the pain. You left your mark upon my skin, your silence on the floor, And a bottle of brown medicine to keep me from the door.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So pour me a lullaby strong enough to hush the law, Something dark and ninety-proof to cover up the flaw. If morning comes and asks me what I know and what I saw, This whiskey lullaby will be my only alibi, my law.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] They say a woman’s scorn is something righteous to behold, But they don’t see the shaking in a story left untold. I ain’t confessing to the preacher, I ain’t talking to the phone, I’m just praying for a mercy that this bottle thinks I own.  
      
  * \[Tag\] Yeah, pour me a lullaby... let the truth and memory thaw.


* **Musical Description** Raw and stark, recorded with a single microphone. Just Rosie’s voice, trembling with a mix of fear and defiance, and her Martin D-28. The guitar is played simply, with heavy, ringing chords that decay into the room’s silence. It’s a field recording of a confession, the kind of song that felt too real and dangerous for 1963 radio.

---

## 2\) Centennial Park Serenade (1964)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The couples have gone home now, the children are asleep, And the promises the daylight makes are promises they’ll keep. But I’m out here with the statues and a guitar full of tunes, Singing to the fireflies and the half-forgotten moons.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So drop a dime in my shadow, let the stars sing back, Leave a penny for my troubles in this worn-out railroad track of a song. I’ll play for all the dreamers who are sleeping in the dark, Just a lonely nightingale serenading in the park.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] The rhythm of the traffic is a slow and distant drum, For every car that passes, there’s a new song to be sung. About the girl behind the wheel, or the man who’s driving home, And why some of us are gathered, and why some are all alone.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So drop a dime in my shadow, let the stars sing back, Leave a penny for my troubles in this worn-out railroad track of a song. I’ll play for all the dreamers who are sleeping in the dark, Just a lonely nightingale serenading in the park.


* **Musical Description** A gentle, fingerpicked ballad in 4/4 time. The production is sparse but warm, centered around Rosie’s intimate vocal and acoustic guitar. A lone, lyrical fiddle provides a sweet counter-melody, like a second voice harmonizing in the quiet night. The mix feels open, capturing the feeling of singing into the vast, empty space of a city park after closing.

---

## 3\) Honky-Tonk Christmas (1966)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] The plastic wreath is dusty on the barroom’s swinging door, The jukebox plays "Silent Night" and I order one drink more. The bartender’s got a Santa hat perched on his weary head, We’re a congregation of the lonely, the forgotten, and misled.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So string the lights on last year’s promises, Pour some tinsel on the blues. We’ll toast the ghosts of Christmases we knew we couldn’t lose. There’s no snow here on the window, just the neon and the rain, Merry Christmas from a barstool, singing through the pain.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] A fella down the counter buys a round for all the strays, He talks about a family in some long-lost yesterday. We don’t ask for details and we don’t tell any lies, We just see the same sad holiday reflected in our eyes.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So string the lights on last year’s promises, Pour some tinsel on the blues. We’ll toast the ghosts of Christmases we knew we couldn’t lose. There’s no snow here on the window, just the neon and the rain, Merry Christmas from a barstool, singing through the pain.


* **Musical Description** A bittersweet 3/4 waltz. The sound is classic Nashville barroom, led by a weeping pedal steel and a slightly out-of-tune upright piano playing melancholy chords. The rhythm is a slow, sad shuffle of brushed snare and quiet bass. Rosie’s vocal is laced with empathy and a touch of bourbon, a carol for those spending the holiday in the blue glow of a neon sign.

---

## 4\) No Velvet in This Town (1969)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] They’re sipping sweet white wine uptown in rooms of silk and lace, Talking ‘bout the authenticity of this old, dirty place. They love the sound of calloused hands as long as they don’t have to touch, They want the stories from the holler, but they don’t want them too much.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] Well, save your velvet, save your pearls, save your highfalutin pity, This ain’t a postcard for your wall, this is a hardworking city. We build our lives on bedrock, not on some soft, satin ground, So save your velvet—this town runs on grit, from the inside out.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] You want to hear a song about the mine, the dust, the fight, Then you go back to your mansion and you sleep all safe at night. You take our pain and polish it until it’s shiny, clean, and sold, Another rhinestone tragedy, a story to be told.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] So save your velvet, save your pearls, save your highfalutin pity, This ain’t a postcard for your wall, this is a hardworking city. We build our lives on bedrock, not on some soft, satin ground, So save your velvet—this town runs on grit, from the inside out.


* **Musical Description** A hard-edged, driving country shuffle. The production is lean and mean, with a snarling Telecaster riff, a punchy rhythm section, and a sawing fiddle that feels more like a weapon than an ornament. Rosie’s vocal is a defiant growl, delivered with the righteous anger of her outlaw persona now in full bloom. It's a clear shot at the Nashville elite, recorded loud and unapologetic.

---

## 5\) Amen in Denim (B-side) (1971)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] Don’t need no stained-glass window to see the morning light, Don’t need a preacher’s sermon to know the wrong from right. Got a prayer in my pocket, got a hymn inside my head, For all the things I should have done and all the words I said.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] It’s an amen in denim, a hallelujah in blue jeans, A little bit of grace for all the in-betweens. For the Saturday night sinner with a Sunday morning heart, Amen in denim—let the sinners try again, and play their part.


* **Musical Description** A simple, unadorned acoustic track, perfect for a B-side. It’s just Rosie and her guitar, recorded with warmth and intimacy. The song is short—barely two minutes—and feels like a personal mantra or a fragment of a larger idea. Her voice is gentle and hopeful, a "pocket benediction" for the listener to carry with them.

---

## 6\) Contract’s Done (1972)

* **Lyrics**  
    
  * \[Verse 1\] For ten long years I’ve sung your songs and played your little games, Smiled for all the cameras while you called me dirty names. You owned my voice, you owned my pen, you owned the sweat and tears, And you paid me in compliments to cover up my fears.  
      
  * \[Chorus\] But the clock is out of minutes, and the ink is finally dry, You can keep the golden records, I will keep the reason why. So ink the truth: the contract’s done, and so am I. This girl is heading back to where the mountains touch the sky.  
      
  * \[Verse 2\] You packaged up my anger and you sold it on the air, You put me on a pedestal and told me not to care. But every note was one note closer to this final, sweet release, A ten-year prison sentence that I’m finally at peace with.  
      
  * \[Outro\] So thank you for the lessons, thank you for the cage, It’s time to turn the microphone right off and turn the page. (Spoken, with a dry laugh) Ink the truth. Contract’s done. So am I.


* **Musical Description** Aggressive, fast, and furious. A hard-charging country-rock tune with snarling electric guitars and a relentless, almost frantic drumbeat. It’s the musical equivalent of packing a bag in a rage. Rosie’s vocal is raw and blistering, spitting the lyrics with venom and relief. The song doesn't fade out; it comes to a screeching halt after the final line, followed by the distinct, final *click* and hum of a guitar amp being shut off.

# Songs Written for Other Artists

## 1\) Borrowed Halo (1966)

* **Written for:** Connie Smith  
    
* **Musical Style:** A pristine, slow-burning countrypolitan ballad in 3/4 time. The production is immaculate, built around soaring pedal steel swells that mimic a church organ and a tasteful string section. The focus is entirely on Connie’s powerful, crystalline voice, capable of conveying immense vulnerability and strength in a single phrase. It’s a song built for a vocal purist.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) I wear my Sunday best each day of the week, I keep my voice down low when I’m supposed to speak. I nod when they talk of virtue, I smile at the right time, And pray they only see the good and never see the crime That’s hiding in the corners of this too-proud heart of mine.  
      
  * (Chorus) 'Cause if I shine at all, it’s on a borrowed halo, Just a fragile ring of light that I try not to let go. I’m just a sinner standing in a saintly afterglow, Hoping heaven doesn’t notice that this halo’s just for show.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) You tell me I’m an angel, that I couldn’t do no wrong, You don’t hear the devil’s fiddle playing in my favorite song. You only see the girl you want, the one who’s pure and true, And I try so hard to be her, Lord, especially for you.

## 2\) Two Left Shoes (1967)

* **Written for:** Loretta Lynn  
    
* **Musical Style:** A hard-driving, up-tempo honky-tonk shuffle with a no-nonsense backbeat. The sound is pure Butcher Holler-meets-Nashville, led by a twangy Telecaster and a walking bassline that doesn't quit. Loretta’s vocal is front-and-center, full of sassy confidence and plain-spoken wit, delivered with a grin you can hear.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) You come home smelling like perfume I don't wear, With a half-baked story and a guilty stare. You want me to believe you just been out with the boys, Well honey, I wasn’t born yesterday to play with little toys.  
      
  * (Chorus) You can’t dance me straight with two left shoes, You can’t sweet-talk your way out of these walking-out blues. You’re stumbling on your stories, tripping on your lies, So quit your sorry shuffling and look me in the eyes, 'Cause this woman’s done with dancing with a man in your disguise.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) I put the supper on the table, I scrub the kitchen floor, While you’re out two-stepping through some other woman’s door. You think a little wink and grin is gonna make it all okay, But your rhythm’s getting sloppy, and I ain’t inclined to sway.

## 3\) Pretty Don’t Pay the Rent (1968)

* **Written for:** Dolly Parton  
    
* **Musical Style:** A thoughtful, mid-tempo country waltz with a strong narrative core. The arrangement is built around Dolly's intricate acoustic guitar fingerpicking and a warm, melodic bass. Subtle harmonies and a gentle pedal steel add emotional color, but the focus is on the storytelling. Dolly’s voice is bright and clear, full of country wisdom and heartfelt sincerity.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) A girl can get by for a little while on a smile and ribbons in her hair, A fella might buy you a soda pop if you act like you don’t have a care. They’ll tell you that your face is your fortune, a treasure to behold, But a pocket full of compliments won’t keep you from the cold.  
      
  * (Chorus) 'Cause pretty buys a lipstick, and pretty buys a dance, Pretty might just get you a sweet-talking second glance. But you can’t trade a blue eye for a roof above your head, Pretty buys a smile; backbone pays the bills and buys the bread.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) I learned to count my own dimes, learned to stand up on my feet, Learned a woman’s mind is sharper than her manners are sweet. So I’ll thank you for the flattery, I surely wish you well, But the story that my ledger book and my own two hands can tell Is the only one I’m banking on this side of heaven or hell.

## 4\) Line of Credit Hearts (1969)

* **Written for:** Tammy Wynette  
    
* **Musical Style:** A sweeping, dramatic countrypolitan torch song. The production is lush and heartbreaking, with a full string orchestra that swells and cries behind Tammy’s iconic, tear-filled vocal. The weeping pedal steel is a central voice, answering her pained phrases. The song builds to a massive, emotionally devastating climax, designed to showcase the legendary ache in her delivery.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) You gave me promises on paper, sealed them with a kiss, Said your love was endless, a treasure I can’t miss. So I spent my trust so freely, I invested every tear, Never checking the balance, never listening to my fear.  
      
  * (Chorus) But I’ve been charging up a heartbreak I can’t afford to pay, Running on a line of credit hearts you gave away. The interest is my loneliness, the debt is my regret, And the letters coming due just say you haven’t loved me yet.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) I’m emotionally bankrupt, with nothing left to give, You’ve foreclosed on the happiness I needed just to live. And the wreckage of this love affair is all that I can see, A pile of overdue notices from your heart to me.

## 5\) Backseat Baptisms (1970)

* **Written for:** Wanda Jackson  
    
* **Musical Style:** A high-octane rockabilly rave-up. Driven by a slap-back bass, a frantic Gretsch guitar riff, and pounding, Jerry Lee Lewis-style piano. Wanda attacks the lyric with her signature growl, full of rebellious energy and playful swagger. The production is raw and electric, with handclaps and a driving snare that makes you want to dance with the devil on a Saturday night.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) Preacher’s talking fire and brimstone from a pulpit made of pine, Says you gotta walk the straight and narrow, gotta toe that holy line. But me and my new fella, we found a different way, We get our souls a-singing in his daddy’s Chevrolet\!  
      
  * (Chorus) We got holy water in a glovebox cup, The radio’s our choir, so we turn it way up\! Yeah, we’re heading for salvation with the pedal to the floor, A-getting backseat baptisms and coming back for more\!  
      
  * (Verse 2\) He whispers me a sermon when the moon is shining bright, Says, "Honey, loving you just has to be all right\!" We ain’t got no steeple, we ain’t got no fancy pews, We just got the gospel of the rock and rollin’ blues\!

## 6\) Holler Comes to Town (1971)

* **Written for:** Jeannie C. Riley  
    
* **Musical Style:** A talk-sing narrative with a driving, bass-heavy groove, reminiscent of "Harper Valley P.T.A." A funky country backbeat is punctuated by horn stabs and a sly, rhythmic Telecaster. Jeannie C. delivers the lines with a knowing wink and a gossipy cadence, like she’s spilling all the town’s secrets over the backyard fence.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) Mrs. Mabel Green, who leads the choir every week, Was seen sneaking out the back of that motel by the creek. And the fire chief’s good son, who always seemed so shy, Well, his car was parked right next to hers, ain’t that a sweet surprise?  
      
  * (Chorus) Oh, when the holler comes to town, every whisper finds a mic, Every secret in the shadow gets put under the spotlight. You can hide your little scandals out beyond the county line, But when the holler comes to town, honey, all your business is mine.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) The mayor’s talking progress while he’s shaking every hand, But his pretty new assistant just bought a piece of land. It’s funny how her bank account just happened to expand, Right after that new zoning law went through, you understand.

## 7\) Ain’t Asking, Just Playing (1972)

* **Written for:** Tanya Tucker  
    
* **Musical Style:** A confident, mid-tempo country-rocker with a rebellious swagger. The sound is tougher than traditional country, with crunchy electric guitar chords, a solid, thumping bass line, and a powerful drum beat. Tanya’s raspy, wise-beyond-her-years vocal sells the lyric with a mix of youthful fire and undeniable authority.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) You’ve been hanging around this jukebox, feeding it my dimes, Telling all your buddies you’re just biding your sweet time. You think you’ve got me figured out, a prize that can be won, You’re acting like the race is over ‘fore it’s even run.  
      
  * (Chorus) Well, I ain’t asking, I’m just playing, this ain’t a game for you to win, This heart ain’t up for auction, so don’t you dare come walking in. If you want to dance with me tonight, you’ll do it on my terms, you see, So say yes or get gone, boy, the choice is up to me.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) Don’t you lean in closer, don’t you whisper in my ear, Don’t you tell me what you think a girl like me might want to hear. This ain’t a negotiation, there ain’t no compromise, Just a simple situation you can see right in my eyes.

## 8\) Rhinestone Alibi (1972)

* **Written for:** Brenda Lee  
    
* **Musical Style:** A sophisticated, torchy, blues-inflected country-pop number. The arrangement is polished, with a walking bassline, subtle organ pads, and a clean, reverb-laden electric guitar. Brenda’s powerhouse voice is controlled but simmering with emotion, delivering a performance that’s equal parts wounded and defiant. It’s a song for a grown-up, world-weary vocalist.  
    
* **Lyrics**  
    
  * (Verse 1\) You walk in smelling of the rain, but honey, it ain’t rained all night, You tell a story ‘bout a friend in trouble, and a car that broke down right Underneath a streetlamp, miles and miles away from here, Your words are all so perfect, but your eyes aren’t half as clear.  
      
  * (Chorus) And your rhinestone alibi shines cheap in the daylight, It sparkles like a promise, but it doesn’t hold up right. It’s a pretty little story, all glitter, gloss, and sin, But your rhinestone alibi is wearing mighty thin.  
      
  * (Verse 2\) You could have just been honest, you could have told the truth and run, Instead you built this palace of the damage that you’ve done. You dressed your lie in sequins, hoping I’d be colorblind, But a fake is still a fake, no matter how bright it’s designed.
