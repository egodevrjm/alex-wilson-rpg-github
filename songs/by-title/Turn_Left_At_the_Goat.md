## Description
A spirited Americana tune with a wink and a nod, "Turn Left At the Goat" is a backroads anthem filled with quirky characters and homespun wisdom. Driven by a lively train-beat shuffle at 118 BPM, the song features bright acoustic guitar strums, twangy electric guitar licks, a playful fiddle, and banjo rolls. Anchored by a woody upright bass and a punchy kick drum, the track boasts dry, honeyed vocals with tight harmonies on the catchy chorus. A talk-sung interlude adds a touch of comedic flair. The song celebrates the joy of getting lost (and found) on life's less-traveled paths, guided by a unique and memorable landmark: a goat.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
GPS got drunk on gravel, swore my driveway was a lake,
Said “Recalculating” like a preacher when I brag about my mistakes.
Banjo (that’s my dog) won’t shotgun ’less the window’s down for wind,
He’s judge and jury, tail for gavel—bangs a sentence on my grin.
Stopped for gas at Mary’s store, paid in nickels, charms, and notes,
Her sign says “ICE • WORMS • WISDOM,” and “Turn left at the goat.”

Chorus
Turn left at the goat, past the truck with only third gear,
Wave at Earl who’s fixin’ nothing, drinkin’ something, call it “cheer.”
If the road turns into rumor, baby, that’s the way we roll—
Follow laughter like a headlight down a blacktop soul.
County lines are punchlines on a map we never wrote,
When life gets complicated, just turn left at the goat.

Verse 2
Saw the sheriff at the four-way, flashin’ lights for five-dollar pies,
He said, “Boy, slow down your pretty, folks are crashin’ with their eyes.”
I said, “Sir, I’ll keep it legal,” (which is funny, bless my heart)
’Cause my filter’s like a screen door with a dog-shaped hole for smart.
Girl in boots said, “Play me somethin’ makes my ex wish he had notes.”
I shrugged, struck sparks, and told her, “Meet me left of that goat.”

Chorus
Turn left at the goat, where the creek makes gossip cold,
Where a kiss can fix a Friday and the moon forgets to scold.
If the night starts talkin’ nonsense, let it tell us where to go—
We’ll collect the best mistakes and let tomorrow be the joke.
Happiness is homemade and the recipe’s a oath:
Add a little wrong turn, then turn left at the goat.

Break (Talk-Sing)
Now if you pass a rusted silo wearin’ ivy like a coat,
You went too far—smile, reverse—still gotta left at the goat.

Verse 3
Barn dance beats the thunder, crickets run the P.A.
My guitar’s a pocket lighter—flick, and daylight looks away.
I don’t promise Sunday endings to a Saturday that smokes,
But I’ll leave you with a chorus you can hum through paper yolks.
If we fall in like we meant it, let the punchline take the boat,
We’ll float right past forever—hey, then left at the goat.

Bridge
I treat love like a road sign hand-painted on a fence,
Crooked but it gets you there—truth with a little rinse.
If we crash into a memory, we’ll stick it in a note,
Frame it on the fridge that’s just past left at the goat.

Chorus (Lift)
Turn left at the goat, past the choir of lightning bugs,
Where the stars are nosy neighbors and the night hands out its hugs.
If the story needs a twist, sweetheart, I was born to quote—
“Buckle up, say yes, and turn left at the goat.”
County lines are punchlines and we’re livin’ the footnote,
So sign your name beside mine—right beneath the goat.

Tag
When in doubt, ask Mary; when in love, take note:
Life’s a backroad comedy—turn left at the goat.

Outro
Yeah, turn left at the goat. (Fiddle and Banjo Outro)
