### **The Outlaw Notebooks of Rosie Walker: A Song Catalog (1969–2022)**

This collection represents the life’s work of Rosie Walker (Judith Wilson), tracked from her early, defiant barn-burners of the late 1960s to her final, flinty farewell. The arc moves from a young woman fighting for her name and artistic control, through the battles of labor, family, and politics, and into a legacy of fierce, tender resilience.

  **Verse 1:** They said, “Sugar, take it easy, put some pearls where teeth should be Trade your boots for glass and glitter, let the boys hold up the key.” I said, “Glass is just a fracture looking for a place to land— I keep iron in my footsteps and a truth inside my hand.”  
    
  **Chorus:** I wear a steel-toed halo, scuffed and bright with sin If heaven wants me tidy, they can dust me when I’m in Don’t tell me how to walk or pray—just move and watch me go I wear a steel-toed halo and I don’t tiptoe.  
    
  **Verse 2:** They pressed a corset ‘round a chorus, tried to cinch my every breath Said, “A lady hums in C and smiles herself to death.” I tuned my strings to thunder, let the barroom make it rain If pretty means obedient, baby—lose my name.  
    
  **Chorus:** I wear a steel-toed halo, righteous, rough, and true You bless the curb I jumped, I’ll bless the road I choose The gate is never narrow when a woman says it so I wear a steel-toed halo and I don’t tiptoe.  
    
  **Bridge:** If grace is just a whisper, find a louder church for me If faith can’t hold a woman’s weight, it ain’t the faith I need.

  **Pre-Chorus:** You pin me in a frame and I’ll kick through the glass You ask me for a curtsy, I’ll deliver a pass.

  **Verse 2:** They said, “Be sweet, don’t shorten men, keep sugar in your tone,” But sugar rots a good guitar and quiet breaks a bone I’ll sweeten when I choose it, not when you collect the dues If kindness is a muzzle here, I’ll sing the kind that bruises.  
    
  **Chorus:** Smile more, my foot— here’s a new decree I’ll keep my mouth wide open where the truth can breathe You want a photo? Take it while I’m gone— Smile more, my foot; I’m already movin’ on.

  **Chorus (Sung):** Tear up that Good Wife Clause...

  * **Instrumentation:** Fingerpicked D-28, light pedal steel, brushed snare on choruses, upright bass blooms, small harmony “oohs.”


* **Lyrics:**  
    
  **Verse 1:** I swore I’d keep the case latched tight, let silence be my friend But a boy with thunder in his throat made that promise end Laid her gentle on your knee—old spruce, young fire— “Kid, the song will tell you when; just don’t call it liar.”  
    
  **Chorus:** Betty stays, but you can roam Make a stage out of this home If the world comes askin’ who— Say the mountains taught you true.  
    
  **Verse 2:** Every scar upon this top is just a map of where we’ve been Every groove in rosewood grain remembers blood and grin Play it kind, play it mean, but mean it when you play— If the truth gets loud enough, it don’t have to beg to stay.  
    
  **Bridge:** When the neon hums like bees Tune your heart and bend your knees When the crowd leans in to hear— Let the quiet pull them near.  
    
  **Final Chorus \+ Tag:** Betty stays… **Tag:** Pick soft as a prayer, hard as rent.

  **Pre-Chorus:** Put your worries on the bar— We’ll buy grace by the jar.  
    
  **Chorus:** Neon benediction, bless this rickety crowd We ain’t pretty, we ain’t rich, but damn we’re singing loud If heaven tallies virtue points, we’ll let the angels score— I’ll take mercy in the melody and order one more pour.  
    
  **Verse 2:** Tambourines in callused hands, prayers in boots and jeans Every chorus scrubs a stain the daylight never cleans If redemption needs a key, we’ll cut it out of noise— Turn the night to hallelujahs sung by barroom boys.  
    
  **Breakdown (Claps \+ Vocal):** Say “Amen,” say it twice— Make the wrong notes sound like right.  
    
  **Double Chorus \+ Shout Tag:** Neon benediction… **Tag:** Last call for sinners—same as saints.

**18\) Tin Crown King (2016)**

  **Chorus:** Tin crown king, you can’t buy my ring Gold leaf cracks when the truth starts to sing Raise your voice, girls—shake off that sting We don’t kneel to a tin crown king.  
    
  **Verse 2:** He talks about our bodies like a billboard on his road Acts like power is a birthright and the rest of us are owed But sisters wrote a ledger he can’t bully or erase— Paid in songs and courtrooms—put that grin back in its place.

* **Lyrics:**  
    
  **Verse 1:** You said “Smile, baby,” like a tip jar with a gun Closed the door behind your name and told me I was “fun.” But I ain’t your office rumor and I ain’t your alibi— I’m the verse that gets you sober when the chorus testifies.  
    
  **Chorus:** I am not your song, not your story to revise Not a chorus you can copyright or body you can prize I am not your hush, not your edit, not your “please”— Take your hands off what you never earned from me.  
    
  **Verse 2:** You said “That’s just how he is,” like weather or a sneeze Asked me for a second chance then called your lawyer, “Please.” But I brought sisters with me and we don’t forget the tune— You can keep your open secrets; we’ll be singin’ truth by noon.  
    
  **Bridge (Spoken/Sung):** **(Spoken)** “Believe me.” **(Sung)** Believe us. **(Spoken)** “It’s over.” **(Sung)** It’s justice. **(Spoken)** “Just words.” **(Sung)** They cut, they cut.

* **Lyrics:**  
    
  **Verse 1:** Walker’s on the wind some nights, Wilson’s on the mail One name built the legend, one name baked the bread and kale I sign receipts with just a “J” and let the ledger guess— Two names share one backbone; either way, the truth says “yes.”  
    
  **Chorus:** Two names, one spine I bend but hold the line If I’m quiet, it’s by design— Two names, one spine.  
    
  **Verse 2:** One girl walked off bright-lit stages, one girl shelled the peas Both girls hated cages and both answered, “No, thank you, please.” If you’re looking for the real me, check the groove and grain— Different labels on the jar; same good rebel jam remains.  
    
  **Bridge:** A secret ain’t a lie when it’s a door you had to choose— I traded maps for living rooms; that’s how I didn’t lose.

* **Lyrics:**

  **Chorus:** Bottle’s last word? Not in here We’ll write louder year by year If the past comes knockin’ drunk Lock the door; we ain’t that sunk Bottle’s last word— watch it fade We’ll speak life in what we play.  
    
  **Verse 2:** I won’t eulogize your vice nor sanctify the ache But I will name the quiet love that helped me not to break We’ll build a fence of melody ‘round what the dark unmade— And cut a gate for daylight that the shadows can’t evade.  
    
  **Bridge:** Grief can drown or it can teach— We choose shore, we choose reach Pour it out, spill it plain— We’ll sing dry what whiskey claimed.  
    
  **Final Chorus \+ Riff Tag:** Bottle’s last word… (riff fades).

  **Chorus:** Light it up, let it burn What I kept is what I earned Ashes don’t explain a thing— That’s the outlaw in my ring.  
    
  **Verse 2:** Leave a kiss on Betty’s top, a note for what to do: “Play the truth and count to ten; don’t let the truth count you.” If a door won’t open kind, knock twice and then be bold— Kick once for all the women who were told to do as told.  
    
  **Bridge:** If a song survives its singer, don’t you cage it for a sale— Play it loud for those who worked and those who made the bail.

**24\) My Dear Alex (2022)**

* **Song Description:** Rosie's final song, found on the last page of her last notebook, written as a letter to her grandson Alex. It is a work of profound love and warning, a generational masterpiece that acknowledges the family’s ghosts, the poison of their past, and the immense, sacred weight of the gift Alex carries. It is not just a song; it is a last will and testament for the soul, passing the torch with a final, flinty blessing.  
    
* **Style & Production Notes:**  
    
  * **Vibe:** A hymn recorded in a quiet room at dusk.  
  * **Tempo/Feel:** 3/4, \~68 BPM; a slow, stark waltz.  
  * **Key/Progression:** C minor (Cm \- G \- Ab \- Eb \- G \- Cm). The chords feel ancient and heavy, like a mountain ballad.  
  * **Instrumentation:** A single, starkly-mic'd acoustic guitar (her Gibson J-45), played with simple, resonant fingerpicking. A low cello drone enters on the second verse, holding a single note like a foundation of sorrow. The vocal is recorded dry and close, capturing every crackle and breath—not a performance, but a final, whispered confession.


* **Lyrics:**  
    
  **(Verse 1\)** My dear Alex, you were born with a haunting in your bones A little bit of my light, and a shadow not your own You carry your mother’s grace in the angle of your jaw And you’ve got your father’s sorrow, the kind that breaks the law They’ll say your face is fortune, a gift from God above But it’s just the pretty vessel for a hard and heavy love.  
    
  **(Verse 2\)** I have to speak of David now, the wolf that wore his face A broken chord, a hungry ghost who haunted this whole place He drank until the man was gone and only anger stayed But the violence in his history is a debt you’ve already paid You do not have to carry him, you do not have to mend His story was a dead-end road; your life is where it ends.  
    
  **(Chorus)** So you sing the ledger, boy, but you don't sing the lie Your heart’s a Pikeville holler, not a Music City sky Let ‘em see the ghost of me in every chord you strike But God above, whatever you do, let the living man survive Don't let the song become a cage, the way I almost let it be The world will try to own you. Don’t you let it, you hear me?  
    
  **(Verse 3\)** They’ll come with pens and promises, they'll praise your raw-boned truth They'll bottle up your righteous rage and sell it back to youth They'll trade your soul for silver, then charge you for the shine They'll say, "Kid, you're a legend," while they're bleeding you dry But a legend is a dead man that they can still command You keep your feet on solid ground, with that guitar in your hand.  
    
  **(Bridge)** Your face is not a fortune, your voice is not a brand They're the hammer and the anvil God has laid inside your hand To forge a better story than the one they gave to me The only contract worth the ink is the one that sets you free You tell the truth so loud and long it rattles all their teeth And you love the ones beside you, not the strangers underneath the stage.  
    
  **(Final Chorus)** So you sing the ledger, son, but you don't sing the lie Your heart’s a Pikeville holler, not a Music City sky Let ‘em see the ghost of me in every song you write But God Almighty, Alex, you hold on to your own life Don't let the song become your cage, don’t let the legend win The hardest note you'll ever hit is the man you are within.  
    
  **(Outro)** Signed in coal dust, sealed in rust, Your MawMaw, who was dust. Now, go be the song.  
    
  *(A final, gently picked C minor chord rings out and fades to silence.)*

CASSETTE TAPE

24\) My Dear Alex (A Deathbed Confession) (2022)  
Song Description: This is not a song; it is a last will and testament for the soul. Found on a cassette tape in a small player by her bed, this is Rosie's final, fading message to her grandson, Alex. It is a raw, whispered confession, full of labored breaths and the weight of unspoken history. In it, she unburdens herself of the family’s ghosts—the violence, the fame, the sorrow—and offers a final, desperate plea for him to live a life free of the cages that defined her own. It is the most brilliant and devastating piece of writing she ever produced.  
Style & Production Notes:  
Vibe: A last breath, recorded on tape. Utterly raw.  
Tempo/Feel: Pulseless. The song follows the rhythm of her breath, not a metronome.  
Key/Progression: A few unsteady, open chords in C minor, played as if her fingers are too tired to form complex shapes. The guitar sometimes falls silent for several seconds.  
Instrumentation: Her old Gibson J-45, recorded on a simple cassette player. You can hear the creak of the bed, the rustle of sheets, and her soft, intermittent coughs. The vocal is a dry, cracked whisper, so close to the microphone it's almost inside the listener's head. There is no polish, no second take. This is it.  
Lyrics:  
(Spoken, over the sound of a tape recorder button clicking and a faint room hiss)  
Alex… lean in close now. This ain’t a song. It’s a map… of all the places you don’t ever have to go.  
(Verse 1 \- sung, voice a fragile rasp over a barely-strummed Cm chord)  
My dear Alex… my ghost is in your marrow  
A voice that ain’t your own, a path that’s steep and narrow  
You got your mother’s Sunday smile, a kindness in the grain…  
But you wear your father’s shadow like a hard and coming rain  
And they’ll call that pretty poison a gift from God above  
Just remember that it’s ballast… for a dark and heavy love.  
(A soft cough, a pause. The guitar finds an unsteady G chord.)  
(Verse 2 \- more spoken than sung)  
I have to speak of David now… the devil in his blood  
He drank to kill a part of me he never understood  
He saw my ghost on every stage, heard it in every bar  
And he tried to beat the sound of it out of his guitar… and out of you.  
That anger ain’t your bloodright, boy, it’s just a borrowed grave  
He died so you could throw away the ugliest part he gave.  
(Chorus \- the voice finds a flicker of old strength, a desperate clarity)  
So you sing the ledger, son, but God, don’t sing the lie  
Your heart’s a Pikeville holler, not a Music City sky  
That cage of gold and glitter, with its microphone and key…  
Son, it almost swallowed me whole. Don’t you let it swallow thee.  
The world will want your sorrow. It will bid your pain up high.  
Tell ‘em your soul ain’t for sale… and look ‘em in the eye.  
(Verse 3 \- voice cracks, almost a whisper)  
They’ll come with pens and promises, like wolves in smiling skin  
They’ll praise the authentic way you bleed, then tell you where the bleedin’ should begin  
They’ll take your bones for kindling to warm their own damn hands  
And they’ll call you a legend… ‘cause a legend takes commands  
But you’re a man of dirt and bone, with calluses and doubt  
And that’s the only holy thing this song is all about.  
(Bridge \- just voice, the guitar has fallen silent)  
So you break the chain right here. You hear me, Alex?  
You break it.  
You owe that ghost of your father exactly nothing. You owe my ghost nothing.  
Your only debt is to the light inside your chest.  
You pay that debt. You pay it every morning you wake up and choose not to be them.  
(Final Chorus \- a final, ragged breath of melody)  
So sing the ledger, boy… but never sing the lie…  
Your heart’s a Pikeville holler… beneath a real… sky…  
Let ‘em see the ghost of me… in every note you play…  
But let the living, breathing man… be the one who walks away…  
(Outro \- spoken, a final, fading whisper as the tape hisses)  
Don’t be the song… Alex. Be the man.  
Love… your MawMaw…  
(The sound of one last, slow exhale. The tape clicks off.)
