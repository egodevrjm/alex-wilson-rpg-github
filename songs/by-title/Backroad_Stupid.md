## Lyrics

Verse 1:
We were seventeen with a half-tank of gas
Buddy's cousin's moonshine in a Mason jar glass
Duct-taped Roman candles to a shopping cart
Rode it off the boat ramp, man that wasn't smart
Stole the giant chicken from the Dairy Queen
Put it on the principal's roof, best Halloween
Sheriff knew our daddies so he let us slide
Said "Boys, it's a miracle y'all ain't died"

Chorus:
We were backroad stupid, Friday night brave
Moonshine and bad ideas, no one to save
Us from ourselves when the sun went down
Just country boys with nothing to do in a nothing-to-do town
Backroad stupid, young and free
Making memories that no one would believe
Yeah we survived being backroad stupid somehow
And I'd go back and do it again right now

Verse 2:
Tried to make a hot tub in Tommy's truck bed
Tarp and garden hose, we were underfed
In the brain department but we had big dreams
Till it busted through doing thirty, hear his mama scream
Superglued a quarter to the Walmart floor
Watched folks try to pick it up for an hour or more
Launched bottle rockets from between our butt cheeks
Couldn't sit right for about three weeks

Chorus:
We were backroad stupid, Friday night brave
Moonshine and bad ideas, no one to save
Us from ourselves when the sun went down
Just country boys with nothing to do in a nothing-to-do town
Backroad stupid, young and free
Making memories that no one would believe
Yeah we survived being backroad stupid somehow
And I'd go back and do it again right now

Bridge:
Put Vaseline on every door handle at the school
Flipped the gym teacher's Smart Car in the pool
Caught a possum, set it loose in the dollar store
Zip-tied shopping carts to the mayor's back door
Convinced little Jimmy that the water tower
Was a spaceship landing every midnight hour
He stayed up for a month with his daddy's binoculars
We were certified backroad stupid particulars

Chorus:
We were backroad stupid, Friday night brave
Moonshine and bad ideas, no one to save
Us from ourselves when the sun went down
Just country boys with nothing to do in a nothing-to-do town
Backroad stupid, young and free
Making stories that get better with every beer we drink
Yeah we survived being backroad stupid somehow
And I'd go back and do it again right now
Oh, I'd go back and do it again right now

Outro:
(Spoken over music)
"Remember when we greased that pig andâ€”"
"That was YOUR idea!"
"Well who brought the Crisco?"
(Music fades with laughter)

## Performance Notes

Upbeat country pop at 120 BPM in G major. The song kicks off with a bright acoustic guitar intro and a playful, syncopated riff. Banjo picking sparkles throughout, particularly spotlighted between verses. Verses are driven by strong backbeat drums, playful cowbell accents, and hand claps on beats 2 and 4, adding to the infectious energy. Choruses explode with layered gang vocals, overdriven electric guitar power chords, whoops, and wild shout-alongs. After the second chorus, a slide guitar and fiddle trade fiery solos, layered with fun sound effects (splash, crash, chicken clucking) tucked subtly in the mix to enhance the storytelling. A key change up a half step to Ab for the final chorus could add even more energy. The outro fades out to the chaotic energy of friends comically arguing by a tailgate, with the music gradually dying down to a final acoustic strum and echoing laughter.
