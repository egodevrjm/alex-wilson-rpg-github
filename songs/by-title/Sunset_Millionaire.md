## Description
'Sunset Millionaire' is a feel-good country anthem celebrating the simple joys in life and the wealth of friendship, nature, and shared experiences. It contrasts the superficial riches of Wall Street with the genuine fulfillment found in a community, a cold beer, and a breathtaking sunset. Alex Wilson's warm vocals and relatable lyrics paint a vivid picture of a working-class hero who understands that true wealth isn't measured in dollars and cents, but in the richness of human connection and appreciation for the present moment. It's a modern take on classic country themes of hard work, gratitude, and the importance of finding happiness in the everyday.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Got a cooler full of beer and a truck that's paid for
Parking lot view of God's front door
Buddy's got his guitar, Sarah's got her laugh
Richer than I've ever been with fifty bucks cash

[Chorus]
I'm a sunset millionaire
Got a fortune in the air
When the sky turns gold and the day is done
I'm the richest poor boy under the sun
Yeah I'm a sunset millionaire
Don't need money when the evening's there

[Verse 2]
Wall Street boys in their fancy suits
Never felt this rich in their leather boots
My portfolio's a tailgate and some good friends
Dividends pay out when the daylight ends

[Chorus]
I'm a sunset millionaire
Got a fortune in the air
When the sky turns gold and the day is done
I'm the richest poor boy under the sun
Yeah I'm a sunset millionaire
Don't need money when the evening's there

[Bridge]
Dow Jones can't buy this feeling
Bank account ain't got this meaning
Got a woman by my side, shining bright
These simple things just feel so right

[Chorus]
I'm a sunset millionaire
Got a fortune in the air
When the sky turns gold and the day is done
I'm the richest poor boy under the sun
Yeah I'm a sunset millionaire
Don't need money when the evening's there

[Outro]
Sunset millionaire, yeah that's me
Living like a king, happy and free
Sunset millionaire, watching the day fade
Making memories that'll never degrade.

## Performance Notes

'Sunset Millionaire' is best performed with a driving, mid-tempo feel. Instrumentation should include acoustic guitar (prominent), electric guitar (subtle twang), bass guitar (walking bass line), drums (kick, snare, hi-hat emphasizing the backbeat), and potentially a banjo or mandolin for added country flavor. Consider adding subtle harmonies during the choruses to enhance the vocal texture. The tempo should be around 120 BPM. The song is well-suited for singalongs and audience participation during live performances. The guitar solo (if any) should be short and melodic, emphasizing the feel-good vibe of the song. The key of G Major works well for a bright, optimistic feel and suits a male vocal range.
