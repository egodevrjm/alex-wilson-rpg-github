- **Scenario_04_The_Vegas_Residency_A_five_year_100_million_contra.md**: **The Vegas Residency:** A five-year, $100 million contract to be the resident headliner at a new Las Vegas casino. He would play the same 90-minute greatest hits show, five nights a week. It is immense wealth and security, but it's the definition of selling outâ€”a comfortable, creative death.
- **Scenario_05_The_Independent_Label_His_hero_a_legendary_and_fie.md**: **The Independent Label:** His hero, a legendary and fiercely independent artist (like a Jason Isbell or Sturgill Simpson type), has offered to partner with him to start a new, artist-owned record label. It would be a financial struggle, a constant grind, and he'd be turning his back on mainstream stardom. But it would give him complete creative freedom for the rest of his life.
