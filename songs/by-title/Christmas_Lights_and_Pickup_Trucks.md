## Lyrics

[Intro]
(Bright acoustic guitar riff with fiddle flourishes and subtle jingle bells)

[Verse 1]
Daddy's on the rooftop with a tangled ball of wire
Mama's yellin' "Be careful!" while he's climbin' even higher
Got the Chevy runnin', radio playin' Strait
Neighbors gathered 'round to watch him decorate
The extension cord's too short, now he's cussin' at the tree
Grandma's sippin' whiskey in her Christmas sweater spree
Kids are catchin' snowflakes on their tongues out in the yard
This December's lookin' like a Hallmark Christmas card

[Chorus]
It's Christmas lights and pickup trucks
Silver bells and our kind of luck
Got the whole town glowin' like a honky-tonk on Friday night
Hot chocolate with a bourbon twist
Underneath that mistletoe kiss
Everything's merry and bright
With Christmas lights and pickup trucks

[Verse 2]
Uncle Jim's directin' traffic with a candy cane
Sister's got her boyfriend trapped beneath the windowpane
Dogs are barkin' carols at the blow-up Santa Claus
Someone started bettin' when the whole thing's gonna fall
We strung lights on the mailbox, the fence, and Daddy's Ford
Even wrapped the chicken coop in green and red decor
The power bill's gonna kill us come January first
But tonight we're shinin' brighter than the Bethlehem star burst

[Chorus]
It's Christmas lights and pickup trucks
Silver bells and our kind of luck
Got the whole town glowin' like a honky-tonk on Friday night
Hot chocolate with a bourbon twist
Underneath that mistletoe kiss
Everything's merry and bright
With Christmas lights and pickup trucks

[Bridge]
(Music drops to acoustic guitar and soft fiddle)
Some folks got their fancy stores and big city Christmas scenes
But give me dirt road wonderlands and homemade figurines
Where the best gift that you'll ever get
Is knowin' everyone you love
Is right here yet

[Verse 3]
Now the kids are inside gathered 'round the fireplace
Tellin' stories 'bout Santa and his reindeer chase
The fire's cracklin' softly, castin' shadows on the wall
Just another perfect Christmas, yeah, we're havin' a ball

[Final Chorus]
(Key change up to A Major, full band enters with energy)
It's Christmas lights and pickup trucks
Silver bells and our kind of luck
Got the whole town glowin' like a honky-tonk on Friday night
Hot chocolate with a bourbon twist
Mama's "secret recipe" wish list
Everything's merry and bright
Yeah, everything's merry and bright
With Christmas lights and pickup trucks

[Outro]
(Fiddle and steel guitar trade-off over acoustic rhythm)
Christmas lights and pickup trucks
(Jingle bells and fade)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (foundation rhythm), Twangy electric guitar (fills and licks, Telecaster recommended), Fiddle (leads and harmonies), Steel guitar (fills, pedal steel preferred), Upright or electric bass, Shuffle drums with train beat, Jingle bells (prominent in chorus). Tempo: Upbeat and energetic, but not rushed. Vocals: Lead vocal with harmonies in the chorus and bridge. Key Change: The key change in the final chorus should be smooth and uplifting, enhancing the festive feel. The outro should fade out gradually, leaving the listener with a warm, Christmas feeling. Consider adding a brief instrumental break after the second chorus featuring the fiddle and steel guitar. The Steel guitar should use volume swells in between lyrical lines, adding an emotional depth to the music. The train beat should be played by the drummer using brushes on the snare to enhance the texture. The bass should follow a walking bassline pattern to add to the forward motion.
