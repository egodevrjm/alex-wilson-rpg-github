## Lyrics

(Intro – Shouted over a distorted Telecaster riff)
Yeah! Come on now!
Let’s hear it for them Southern girls!

(Verse 1)
She can rock a sundress or them cut-off jeans,
Knows every word to "Sweet Home" and what it means.
Pulls up in a pickup with the radio loud,
Walks into the bar and she owns that crowd.
From her sweet tea smile to her "boy, watch this," 
Ain’t nothin’ like the feel of a Southern kiss.

(Pre-Chorus)
She’s got that sugar and fire, sweet and wild,
Every guy in here's thinkin' the same thing right now—

(Chorus)
I love me a Southern woman, wild as a July night,
Dancin' in them boots 'til the morning light.
She’s got a laugh that rolls like a Delta storm,
And a heart that’ll keep your cold hands warm.
Yeah, give me that drawl, that sway, that grin—
I love me a Southern woman!

(Verse 2)
She’ll two-step better than the boys back home,
And pour a little whiskey like it’s sweet cologne.
Bonfire queen with the red-hot hair,
Or a blonde bombshell in the county fair.
She’s shotguns, sun tans, and backroad bliss,
And I can’t get enough of a girl like this.

(Pre-Chorus)
From the beach to the mountains, they got that style,
Every head turns when they walk that mile—

(Chorus)
I love me a Southern woman, wild as a July night,
Dancin' in them boots 'til the morning light.
She’s got a laugh that rolls like a Delta storm,
And a heart that’ll keep your cold hands warm.
Yeah, give me that drawl, that sway, that grin—
I love me a Southern woman!

(Bridge – Party chants)
Hey! (Hey!)
Y’all raise ‘em up now!
Hey! (Hey!)
For the Southern girls somehow—
Got that sass, that class, that country charm,
They’ll steal your heart ‘fore they twist your arm!

(Guitar Solo - over verse chords, building in intensity)

(Chorus – Repeat big & loud)
I love me a Southern woman, wild as a July night,
Dancin' in them boots 'til the morning light.
She’s got a laugh that rolls like a Delta storm,
And a heart that’ll keep your cold hands warm.
Yeah, give me that drawl, that sway, that grin—
I love me a Southern woman!

(Outro – Crowd shout, fading out with guitar riff)
Yeah, I love me a Southern woman!
Turn it up, y’all!
Whoo!
