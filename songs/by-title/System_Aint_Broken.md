## Description
A raw and unflinching critique of systemic inequality, 'System Ain't Broken' channels the struggles of working-class America, particularly those in Appalachia. Alex Wilson's gritty vocals deliver a powerful message that the system isn't failing, but rather functioning precisely as intended: to perpetuate poverty and maintain the status quo. The song blends elements of outlaw country, Americana, and folk-rock, creating a stark and confrontational atmosphere.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I worked double shifts, kept my grades up high,
Dodgin' every blow under Appalachia sky.
Daddy drank his fill, left me with the scars,
Now he's gone, they send men behind bars.

[Pre-Chorus]
They never noticed when my world was dark,
But now they step in, make their hollow mark.

[Chorus]
The system ain't broken, workin' just fine,
Keep the poor down, walk the same old line.
Switch up the names, still dealin' the pain,
But the system ain't broken—it's rigged like a game.

[Verse 2]
You tell me now you're protectin' the youth,
But you're years too late, I'm livin' proof.
I survived your silence, now you're makin' noise,
Makin' headlines off our shattered joys.

[Pre-Chorus]
Where were you when the whiskey poured like rain?
Only showin' up now, just to stake your claim.

[Chorus]
The system ain't broken, workin' just fine,
Keep the poor down, walk the same old line.
Switch up the names, still dealin' the pain,
But the system ain't broken—it's rigged like a game.

[Bridge]
Guard whispers softly, "System's got cracks,"
But the scars I wear say it's right on track.
Justice arrives, but always too slow,
Reapin' headlines from seeds they didn't sow.

[Verse 3]
Politicians preachin' 'bout a promised land,
While their pockets fill with blood-stained hands.
Empty promises echo through the hills,
Another generation payin' for their thrills.

[Final Chorus]
The system ain't broken, it's workin' as planned,
Keep the beaten down, under heavy hand.
Different faces, but the story's the same,
The system ain't broken—it thrives on our shame.

[Outro]
Yeah, the system ain't broken, it runs on our pain,
Feedin' on sorrow, it's perfectly trained.
It's perfectly trained...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Focus on acoustic instruments: steel-string acoustic guitar (played with a mix of fingerpicking and strumming for dynamics), banjo (sparse and mournful), upright bass (driving and simple), and possibly a harmonica or fiddle for added texture. Drums are minimal – a simple, steady beat with a focus on the kick and snare.

Tempo: Medium tempo, around 120 BPM, creating a sense of relentless forward motion.

Key: Em (E minor) for a somber and melancholic feel. The song would benefit from some slide guitar riffs in Em pentatonic.

Vocals: Alex Wilson's delivery should be raw and emotionally charged, emphasizing the pain and anger in the lyrics. Backing vocals could be added in the chorus for emphasis, with harmonies that are slightly dissonant to create a sense of unease.

Arrangement: The song should build in intensity throughout, starting with a simple arrangement in the verses and gradually adding more instruments in the choruses and bridge. The final chorus and outro should be the most powerful and emotionally resonant parts of the song. An instrumental break with a fiddle solo would fit perfectly after the 2nd chorus.

Production: Aim for a raw and natural sound, avoiding excessive polish or effects. Let the imperfections of the performance shine through to enhance the song's authenticity.
