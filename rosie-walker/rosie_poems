Lyrics
Verse 1 Signed my name with a kitchen pen, flour dust on my jeans, Hung my rhinestones on a nail, let the quiet wash me clean. Kept the spark, lost the circus, I ain’t changin’ what I won— If heels were shackles yesterday, this ring’s my loaded gun.

Pre‑Chorus No choir needed, no big show— I’ll write my vows in mountain snow.

Chorus Shackles off, ring on— I ain’t beggin’ to belong, I married my own backbone, now watch me carry on. If Nashville needs apologies, they’ll wait ‘til kingdom come— Shackles off, ring on; baby, that’s how freedom’s done.

Verse 2 Paper says “Mrs.”, but the pilot’s seat says “me,” I’ll steer by coal‑town starlight and a kitchen’s rosary. Silence ain’t surrender, it’s a sharpened, holstered tongue— I didn’t quit; I picked my fight— and honey, I already won.

Pre‑Chorus No pearls required, no white glove— This gold band fits the fist I love.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge They say the stage is where I live— I say a porch can shout and give. If home’s a rebel state of mind, Then sign me in and draw the line.

Chorus You were born red, born ready, loud in a quiet room, With a boot‑kick heartbeat marchin’ like a union tune. World will try to bend your spine; make ‘em pay in truth instead— You were born right, born free—my David, born red.

Verse 2 If a law is bent and blind, you don’t have to make it home, Build a porch from busted rules, carve your name in stone. Love’s a forge and life’s a hammer; sparks are not a sin— Hold the steel ‘til morning light and call the temper “win.”

Verse 1 I got a skillet for a bell and a picket sign for grace, Flour dust like holy smoke on every stubborn face. If the foreman wants our quiet, let him bargain with my pan— I’ll fry his pretty theory up and feed it to the band.

Chorus Bang that pot, ring that bell— this kitchen is a union hall. We don’t beg, we don’t crawl— pay the people, fix the wall. You can sell your velvet promise; bring the ledger, nix the drawl— Bang that pot, ring that bell, we’re a union after all.

Verse 2 Babies sleeping in the coats, coffee thick as oil, We’re the hands that keep this county from collapsing in the soil. “Wait your turn,” the bosses say; we say, “Turn about is due,” Put the numbers on the table, watch us total up what’s true.

Chorus (repeat)

Verse 1 Steel‑toed vows and a lunch‑pail kiss, you clock where shadows bite, I count your breaths by radiator hiss ‘til porch‑light turns to light. Our treaty ain’t on paper, babe— it’s sweat and mercy due, If the mountain taxes lungs and love, we’ll bill ‘em back through you.

Chorus Night‑shift treaty, pay on time, We won’t trade our life for grime. If the dark demands its fee, Bill the company, set us free.

Verse 2 Clipboard saint says “sign right here,” the devil loves a line, But I’ll keep tally in my bones—what’s yours is also mine. We share the bruise, we share the bread, we share the stubborn dawn, And when they cut the whistle short, we’ll sing this overtime.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge If a prayer can hold a roof, I’ll pray— But bolts and beams are how we stay. Pay us fair and we’ll be kind; Short us once— we’ll change your mind.

Chorus Boy with matches, strike it wise, Fire loves fools and pretty lies. Burn the map if you must roam— Keep a bucket, call it home.

Verse 2 Dare’s a velvet trap with teeth, the crowd will buy your fall, They’ll cheer you from the rooftop then forget to break the wall. If you want to jump, jump far and land where love is paid— Just don’t torch the bridge you built to bring your people shade.

Chorus (repeat)

Guitar Solo (8 bars)

Bridge I ain’t here to fence you in— Just teach you how to fight and win. Carry water, carry light— Make it bright and make it right.

Verse 1 They made a sky show out of bombs, synced it to a score, Commentator calling plays like Friday night before. If victory’s a TV word, then mercy’s off the grid, I’ll raise a flag for every kid who did what grown men did.

Chorus Turn it down, turn it off, War ain’t gospel, pain ain’t cough. If peace is weak in suits like these, I’d rather weak than fall on knees.

Verse 2 Sand can swallow all our names and sell the dust as pride, I won’t buy the fireworks when children learn to hide. If blood becomes a ratings bump, then bless the switch we pull— I’ll teach my boy to love the world and call that beautiful.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge (spoken) “Count the cost.” (sung) Count it twice. (spoken) “Glory’s cheap.” (sung) Life’s the price. (spoken) “Change the frame.” (sung) Change the news. (together, sung) Choose the truth we choose.

Lyrics
Verse 1 Got a ledger full of coughing, forty winters past due date, Doctors wrote “regrettable,” the check arrived too late. I ain’t kneeling at your altar of acceptable lost men— Send the bill to the boss’s god and run it through again.

Chorus Bill the company, add the years, Interest paid in miner tears, If you can count the tonnage, boys, Count the lungs and count the fears.

Verse 2 Company doctor says “now breathe”—black snow in July, Clipboard mercy, rubber stamp, “sign here” then goodbye. If your profits ride a rail car built on borrowed air, Then cut a check for every breath that never made it there.

Chorus (repeat)

Verse 3 (breakdown) Twenty‑nine lunch pails waitin’ where the pay window should be, Whistle blows for ghosts again—call it “accident,” not me. If bolts run hot and roof runs low, shut it down, make safe— You don’t pray a shaft to hold; you brace it, life by life.

Bridge Don’t you dare say “cost of business”; business cost us you— I’ll sign in blood and underline: Pay the families what they’re due.

Verse 1 There were two cries in the night—one fading, one a flame, Heaven kept a brighter star; the earth received a name. I held a brand‑new jawline with an old familiar fight, Said, “Kid, the world just took its cut—now take back what is right.”

Chorus Two cries, one night— love keeps books the law can’t see, If sorrow writes the first line, joy can charge the fee. I’ll raise you like a battle hymn and laugh at what ain’t fair— Two cries, one night— breathe loud and take your share.

Verse 2 I won’t gild the wound with lies nor toast the dying light, But I can seed a future field with what survives this night. We’ll grow a mercy big enough to shade the things we’ve lost— Boy, your breath’s a down payment; I’ll cover all the cost.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge Bless the gone, bless the born— Bless the thorn that guards the corn. Bless the debt we will out‑sing— Bless the fight and what it brings.

Chorus Porch light’s out, city’s bright, Guess who’s payin’ for their flight. Not the suits who rolled the dice— We’ll fix our town and set the price. Porch light’s out, but we ain’t blind— Send the check, and sign the line.

Verse 2 Banker calls it “act of God,” I call it “hands in pies,” Says “Main Street’s in our thoughts,” I say “spare us lullabies.” If you wanna preach about the risk we simple folks don’t get, Explain the yacht and bonus checks; we’ll listen when they’re split.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge Trickle down don’t wet these crops— Turn it up and watch it stop. We know math and we know need— Pay your tab and we’ll proceed.

Verse 1 Twenty‑nine lunch pails sleeping under coal‑black flags, Twenty‑nine hard hats hanging from their kids’ book bags. If “accident” is corporate tongue for murder dressed in gloss, Write the minutes in a widow’s hand and call the true word “loss.”

Chorus Count them right, say their names, Audit every hallway blame. Safety ain’t a line to cut— Shut it down if bolts go strut.

Verse 2 “Production goals,” the memo reads; the roof beam reads “not now.” You cannot pray a shaft to hold then break a sacred vow. If time is money where you sit, our time was spent in skin— Add the years we won’t get back, and pay the living in.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge Bring the lights and bring the forms, Walk the tunnels, feel the storms. Stand where everything went wrong— Listen; that’s a safety song.

Final Chorus (hushed gang) + Fade Count them right…

Chorus Betty stays, but you can roam, Make a stage out of this home. If the world comes askin’ who— Say the mountains taught you true.

Verse 2 Every scar upon this top is just a map of where we’ve been, Every groove in rosewood grain remembers blood and grin. Play it kind, play it mean, but mean it when you play— If the truth gets loud enough, it don’t have to beg to stay.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge When the neon hums like bees, Tune your heart and bend your knees. When the crowd leans in to hear— Let the quiet pull them near.

Lyrics
Verse 1 Neon cross above the till, drummer counting sin, Kid walks in and rooms go still—heard that once again. If church won’t open doors for us, the jukebox will confess— Raise a glass and sing the truth; the good Lord likes a mess.

Pre‑Chorus Put your worries on the bar— We’ll buy grace by the jar.

Chorus Neon benediction, bless this rickety crowd, We ain’t pretty, we ain’t rich, but damn we’re singing loud. If heaven tallies virtue points, we’ll let the angels score— I’ll take mercy in the melody and order one more pour.

Verse 2 Tambourines in callused hands, prayers in boots and jeans, Every chorus scrubs a stain the daylight never cleans. If redemption needs a key, we’ll cut it out of noise— Turn the night to hallelujahs sung by barroom boys.

Pre/Chorus (repeat)

Breakdown (claps + vocal) Say “Amen,” say it twice— Make the wrong notes sound like right.

Double Chorus + Shout Tag Neon benediction… Tag: Last call for sinners—same as saints.

Lyrics
Verse 1 The bottle loves a final say, that bully on the shelf, Spoke for you ‘til you were gone, and all you had was self. Well death can keep his swagger; I won’t toast his hand— I’ll teach your boy a fight song and we’ll outlaw this demand.

Chorus Bottle’s last word? Not in here. We’ll write louder year by year. If the past comes knockin’ drunk, Lock the door; we ain’t that bunk. Bottle’s last word— watch it fade; We’ll speak life in what we play.

Verse 2 I won’t eulogize your vice nor sanctify the ache, But I will name the quiet love that helped me not to break. We’ll build a fence of melody ‘round what the dark unmade— And cut a gate for daylight that the shadows can’t evade.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge Grief can drown or it can teach— We choose shore, we choose reach. Pour it out, spill it plain— We’ll sing dry what whiskey claimed.

Final Chorus + Riff Tag Bottle’s last word… (riff fades)

Chorus Light it up, let it burn, What I kept is what I earned. Ashes don’t explain a thing— That’s the outlaw in my ring.

Verse 2 Leave a kiss on Betty’s top, a note for what to do: “Play the truth and count to ten; don’t let the truth count you.” If a door won’t open kind, knock twice and then be bold— Kick once for all the women who were told to do as told.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge If a song survives its singer, don’t you cage it for a sale— Play it loud for those who worked and those who made the bail.

Final Chorus + Single‑Note Outro Light it up… (one bell‑like harmonic on E)


Optional: Sequencing Notes
If these were compiled as Judith’s Outlaw Notebooks (1973–2022), place them chronologically; the tonal arc moves from chosen quiet (Shackles Off, Ring On) through labor and loss, into legacy handoff (Betty Stays), public joy (Murphy’s Neon Benediction), reckoning (Bottle’s Last Word), and a flinty goodbye (Matchbook Will). Each arrangement is stage‑ready for modern production while staying true to her rebel cadence.

Verse 1
 Ash on Church Street, sirens in the sky,
 Names like rosary beads, we finger them and cry.
 I lit the stove and set a plate for somebody I don’t know,
 Said “If love can cross a county line, it sure can cross that smoke.”
Chorus
 Hold the line, hold the light,
 Don’t turn sorrow into fight.
 If fear comes dressed in flags tonight,
 We’ll choose mercy, we’ll choose right.
Verse 2
 TV men sell breaking hearts with countdowns in the crawl,
 But I won’t buy their thunder if it means we learn to maul.
 Send the blood and bread we can; send hands and not a cheer—
 Let grief make grace, not gasoline; keep cleansing what is dear.
Chorus (repeat)
Bridge
 We’ll read the names like prayers, one breath for every friend,
 And build a better way to live they’d recognize again.
 If anger asks for fire, we’ll answer it with stone—
 Foundations we can stand upon when we walk wounded home.

 Hold the line, hold the light…

 He’s got a tower full of mirrors and a mouth that sells the shine,
 Paints his name on everything and calls it “golden spine.”
 But chrome don’t make a conscience and a crown don’t make a king—
 I’ve seen better men in denim do more righteous thing.
Chorus
 Tin crown king, you can’t buy my ring,
 Gold leaf cracks when the truth starts to sing.
 Raise your voice, girls—shake off that sting,
 We don’t kneel to a tin crown king.
Verse 2
 He talks about our bodies like a billboard on his road,
 Acts like power is a birthright and the rest of us are owed.
 But sisters wrote a ledger he can’t bully or erase—
 Paid in songs and courtrooms—put that grin back in its place.
Chorus (repeat)
Bridge
 No king but voters, no throne but ground,
 No hush for bullies when the women gather ‘round.
 We’ll teach our daughters how to laugh at little men—
 Truth wears boots; it wins in the end.

 Closed the door behind your name and told me I was “fun.”
 But I ain’t your office rumor and I ain’t your alibi—
 I’m the verse that gets you sober when the chorus testifies.
Chorus
 I am not your song, not your story to revise,
 Not a chorus you can copyright or body you can prize.
 I am not your hush, not your edit, not your “please”—
 Take your hands off what you never earned from me.
Verse 2
 You said “That’s just how he is,” like weather or a sneeze,
 Asked me for a second chance then called your lawyer, “Please.”
 But I brought sisters with me and we don’t forget the tune—
 You can keep your open secrets; we’ll be singin’ truth by noon.
Chorus (repeat)

 (spoken) “Believe me.” (sung) Believe us.
 (spoken) “It’s over.” (sung) It’s justice.

Lyrics
Verse 1
 Walker’s on the wind some nights, Wilson’s on the mail,
 One name built the legend, one name baked the bread and kale.
 I sign receipts with just a “J” and let the ledger guess—
 Two names share one backbone; either way, the truth says “yes.”
Chorus
 Two names, one spine,
 I bend but hold the line.
 If I’m quiet, it’s by design—
 Two names, one spine.
Verse 2
 One girl walked off bright-lit stages, one girl shelled the peas,
 Both girls hated cages and both answered, “No, thank you, please.”
 If you’re looking for the real me, check the groove and grain—
 Different labels on the jar; same good rebel jam remains.
Chorus (repeat)
Bridge
 A secret ain’t a lie when it’s a door you had to choose—
 I traded maps for living rooms; that’s how I didn’t lose.
Double Chorus + Tag
 Two names…
 Tag: Call me what you will—my backbone keeps the bill.

Lyrics
Verse 1
 Rain drums eighth‑notes on the tin, freight moans from the ridge,
 Coffee bubbles metronome, kid counts crumbs like bridge.
 Screen door squeaks in D‑flat sad; kettle sings in G—
 Who needs radio when home writes symphonies for free?
Chorus
 Trailer roof symphony, play me something slow,
 Knock on wood and pots and pans until the worries go.
 If the world gets mean and loud, we’ll flip it on its knee—
 Hush now, darling—hear the trailer roof symphony.
Verse 2
 Night train hammers quarter‑notes, coyotes add a part,
 Crickets lay a mandolin behind this beating heart.
 I’ll tune the porch to where we are, not where they said we’d be—
 A choir made of ordinary sounds in perfect key.
Chorus (repeat)
Bridge
 Let the thunder take the toms,
 Let the spoons play country psalms.
 Let the stove keep whistle time—
 Home is meter, love the rhyme.
Final Chorus + Whistle Tag
 Trailer roof symphony… (whistle the motif; fade)

Lyrics

Verse 1 Ash on Church Street, sirens in the sky, Names like rosary beads, we finger them and cry. I lit the stove and set a plate for somebody I don’t know, Said “If love can cross a county line, it sure can cross that smoke.”

Chorus Hold the line, hold the light, Don’t turn sorrow into fight. If fear comes dressed in flags tonight, We’ll choose mercy, we’ll choose right.

Verse 2 TV men sell breaking hearts with countdowns in the crawl, But I won’t buy their thunder if it means we learn to maul. Send the blood and bread we can; send hands and not a cheer— Let grief make grace, not gasoline; keep cleansing what is dear.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge We’ll read the names like prayers, one breath for every friend, And build a better way to live they’d recognize again. If anger asks for fire, we’ll answer it with stone— Foundations we can stand upon when we walk wounded home.

Final Chorus Hold the line, hold the light… Tag: We’ll make a table out of night.

Lyrics

Verse 1 He’s got a tower full of mirrors and a mouth that sells the shine, Paints his name on everything and calls it “golden spine.” But chrome don’t make a conscience and a crown don’t make a king— I’ve seen better men in denim do more righteous thing.

Chorus Tin crown king, you can’t buy my ring, Gold leaf cracks when the truth starts to sing. Raise your voice, girls—shake off that sting, We don’t kneel to a tin crown king.

Verse 2 He talks about our bodies like a billboard on his road, Acts like power is a birthright and the rest of us are owed. But sisters wrote a ledger he can’t bully or erase— Paid in songs and courtrooms—put that grin back in its place.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge No king but voters, no throne but ground, No hush for bullies when the women gather ‘round. We’ll teach our daughters how to laugh at little men— Truth wears boots; it wins in the end.

Double Chorus + Stop Tin crown king… (band hit)

Verse 1 Posterboard on the table, paint cups in the sink, Grandgirls with the Sharpies writing bigger than they think. Aunt May’s got the snacks lined up, Mama’s found the rhyme— If the boys say “bless your heart,” we’ll bless them back in time.

Pre‑Chorus We got boots and bus fare, We got voices—come and dare.

Chorus Signs in the sink, thunder in ink, March in our blood and truth on the brink. Hands in the air, country, beware— These women don’t need your permission to care.

Verse 2 Kettle’s on like a siren, coats piled by the door, Neighbor girls from red‑line streets mix cardboard with the poor. We’ll walk and we’ll remember who taught us how to stand— Grandma’s old rebellious bones still steadyin’ our hand.

Pre/Chorus (repeat)

Breakdown (chant + claps) My body—my song! Your law—won’t wrong! Our town—stands strong!

Double Chorus + Tag Signs in the sink… Tag: Put your feet where your heart’s been thinkin’.

Lyrics

Verse 1 You said “Smile, baby,” like a tip jar with a gun, Closed the door behind your name and told me I was “fun.” But I ain’t your office rumor and I ain’t your alibi— I’m the verse that gets you sober when the chorus testifies.

Chorus I am not your song, not your story to revise, Not a chorus you can copyright or body you can prize. I am not your hush, not your edit, not your “please”— Take your hands off what you never earned from me.

Verse 2 You said “That’s just how he is,” like weather or a sneeze, Asked me for a second chance then called your lawyer, “Please.” But I brought sisters with me and we don’t forget the tune— You can keep your open secrets; we’ll be singin’ truth by noon.

Chorus (repeat)

Bridge (spoken) “Believe me.” (sung) Believe us. (spoken) “It’s over.” (sung) It’s justice. (spoken) “Just words.” (sung) They cut, they cut.

Final Chorus + Out I am not your song… (guitar growl to black)

If you want, I can sequence these with the earlier notebook songs into a career‑spanning posthumous set—Judith Wilson: The Outlaw Notebooks (1973–2022)—and provide a producer’s memo with suggested featured vocalists for a tribute record (e.g., pair “Tin Crown King” with a firebrand vocalist; “Ash on Church Street” with a harmony trio), plus session charts and click tempos.
