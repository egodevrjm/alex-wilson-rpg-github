## SCENE 1: The Problem

**Director:** Set up the financial crisis

**World Engine:**

Alex sits on his apartment floor, back against the bed frame, phone in hand. Betty leans against the wall, fifth string buzzing a little. The check engine light's been on for two weeks—Tommy says it's probably just a sensor.

—------—------—------

His banking app shows the damage in red text: -$47.00 OVERDRAFT FEE. That's on top of the $35 fee from last week. The math is brutally simple: five days until rent, $850 due to a landlord who's already texted twice about "the situation," and Alex has $23 in his pocket plus an overdraft that'll cost him another $35 if he uses the debit card.

His stomach is loud enough he can hear it. Breakfast was gas station coffee. Lunch was skipping lunch because the construction foreman shorted the crew's break.

Three notifications:
1. Instagram DM from Sophie—the girl from that party two weeks ago
2. Spam email: "You're Pre-Approved for $50,000!"
3. Unknown number (615 area code)

Alex stares at the unknown number text first:

**"Hey, this is Marcus from Paradise Park Trailer Court. Your friend Tommy said you might be looking for some work? We need someone for event sound this weekend. $300 for 2 days. Text back if interested."**

Paradise Park. That's Pike County. That's home.

Which means three hours driving on a quarter tank ($45 in gas he doesn't have), which means going back to where everyone knows exactly who he is and what he left, which means—

His phone buzzes. Tommy.

**Tommy:** "You see that text from Marcus?"

What does Alex do?

---

**Director:** Alex calls Tommy instead of texting back

**World Engine:**

Tommy picks up on the first ring. "Before you say no—"

"I ain't said nothing yet," Alex says. He's standing now, pacing the twelve feet his apartment allows.

"You're thinking it. I can hear you thinking it."

"Three hours there, three hours back, gas money I don't have, and that's if the truck don't—"

"Paradise Park pays same day, cash," Tommy cuts in. "Marcus is good people. You do Friday setup and Saturday event, he pays you $300 before you leave Saturday night. I already told him you're good for it."

Alex stops at the window. East Nashville afternoon, gray sky threatening rain. "Why can't you do it?"

"I got that thing with Caleb's sister's restaurant. Besides, Marcus asked for you specifically. Said he remembers you doing sound for that thing at the high school."

"That was six years ago."

"Yeah, well. Apparently you didn't fuck it up." Tommy's eating something, talking around it. "Look, I know it's Pike County. I know that's complicated. But you need $850 by Friday, and Nashville ain't exactly throwing gigs at you this week."

Alex looks at Betty. At his bank app. At the text from his landlord marked 2:14 PM: *Alex I need to know you're good for Friday*

"How much is gas gonna run me?"

"Forty-five, maybe fifty if you're driving like you drive. You got the Kroger card?"

"Three cents off. Real helpful."

"So you spend fifty getting there, work Friday and Saturday, leave with three hundred cash, come back Sunday morning. That's two-fifty profit, plus you're a third of the way to rent."

The math works. The math has to work. But Alex is quiet, and Tommy knows why.

"It's two days," Tommy says, softer now. "You ain't moving back. You're doing a job and leaving."

"MawMaw's house is probably still—"

"Sold last year. New family moved in, I heard. You'd have to stay at the trailer court itself. Marcus said there's a spot."

New family in MawMaw's house. Something about that sits wrong, but Alex doesn't have time to figure out why.

"What's the event?" Alex asks.

"Some kind of bluegrass festival situation? Marcus said it's a weekend thing, couple bands, vendors, whatever. They need PA setup, sound check, running mix both days. Basic shit."

Basic shit for $300. In Pike County.

Alex's stomach makes another noise. He's got $23 and half a sleeve of Ritz crackers.

What does Alex decide?

---

**Director:** Alex agrees to the gig. JUMP: Show me Alex's drive to Pike County on Friday morning.

**World Engine:**

—------—------—------
📍 Location: US-23 South, approaching Pike County line | 📅 Friday, March 17, 6:34 AM | Age: 22

💰 Cash: $8 | Bank: $-82 (second overdraft fee hit)

🎸 Betty: Same (in truck bed) | 🚗 F-150: Gas light on, 12 miles to empty | ⚡ Energy: 5/10 | 🍔 Hunger: 6/10

📣 Followers (X/IG/TikTok/YT): 8,251/12,338/32,104/2,157 | Δ Since Last: +4,-2,+212,+1

CURRENT DYNAMICS:
- Financial Pressure: Rent due TONIGHT, $870 short, landlord waiting
- Equipment Status: Guitar and small PA in truck bed under tarp
- Recent Win: TikTok about "driving home broke" got 212 new followers
- Homecoming Tension: First time back to Pike County in 4 months
—------—------—------

The gas light's been on for eleven miles. Alex is doing that thing where you drive exactly 55 in the right lane, windows down despite the cold because AC burns more fuel, watching the trip computer lie to you about how far 12 miles to empty really means.

He left Nashville at 5:47am to avoid traffic and because he couldn't sleep anyway. Used his last $8 to get enough gas to make it to the Pike County Speedway, where gas is always nineteen cents cheaper because they don't bother updating their pumps and the owner doesn't care.

The TikTok he posted at 5am—just him and the phone, truck interior dark, caption "driving home broke to make rent in the city"—somehow hit different than his usual stuff. 212 new followers by the time he crossed into Kentucky. Comments full of people saying they felt it. Three separate messages asking where he plays in Nashville.

None of that pays rent.

The landscape shifts as he crosses the county line. Mountains closer now, hollers getting deeper, trailers tucked into hillsides. Pine and oak and the particular green of early spring in Eastern Kentucky. A burned-out barn he's known his whole life. The creek that flooded in 2003. The church where MawMaw's funeral was.

Alex hasn't told anyone he's coming. Tommy knows, Marcus knows. That's it.

His phone buzzes in the cupholder. He doesn't look—another .3 miles per gallon saved by not picking it up.

The Speedway appears on the right. Alex coasts into the lot, truck shuddering slightly as he stops at the pump. The same guy who's been working Friday mornings since Alex was fifteen is visible through the window.

Alex digs into the center console. $8 in cash. His debit card that'll trigger another overdraft fee if he uses it. His credit card that's maxed at $500 and currently sitting at $497.

The math: $8 gets him maybe 2.5 gallons. Enough to get to Paradise Park and back to this spot on the way home Sunday, if he's careful. But that's zero margin for error. If he needs to drive anywhere while he's here—

His phone buzzes again.

Alex looks.

**Sophie (Instagram DM, 47 minutes ago):** "hey! playing anywhere this weekend? was thinking about you"

**Marcus (Text, 12 minutes ago):** "Morning! You close? We're setting up at noon. Address is 2847 County Road 412. Can't miss it, follow the signs for 'Holler Music Fest.' Coffee's on when you get here."

**Landlord (Text, 6 minutes ago):** "Alex it's Friday morning. I need to deposit something today."

Alex sits at the pump, engine off, gas light on, $8 in his hand.

What does Alex do?

---

**Director:** Alex puts in the $8, texts the landlord "getting paid tonight, will have it tomorrow," and continues to Paradise Park. SCENE: Alex arrives at Paradise Park.

**World Engine:**

📍 Location: Paradise Park Trailer Court, Pike County, KY | 📅 Friday, March 17, 11:52 AM | Age: 22

💰 Cash: $0 | Bank: $-82

🎸 Betty: In truck | 🚗 F-150: Just under 1/4 tank | ⚡ Energy: 4/10 | 🍔 Hunger: 8/10

📣 Followers: (same) | Δ Since Last: +0,+0,+3,+0

CURRENT DYNAMICS:
- Financial Pressure: CRITICAL - promised landlord money tomorrow, has $0
- Homecoming Weight: Everyone here knows who he was, what he left
- Hunger: Last real meal was Wednesday dinner
—------—------—------

Paradise Park Trailer Court sits at the end of County Road 412, tucked into a holler with Pine Mountain rising behind it. It's nicer than the name suggests—permanent mobile homes on concrete pads, actual gravel roads, a community center building that looks like it was built sometime in the '90s and maintained by people who care.

Alex has been here before. MawMaw knew some people who lived here. Tommy's aunt was here for a while.

A hand-painted banner stretches across the entrance: **"2ND ANNUAL HOLLER MUSIC FEST - MARCH 17-18"**

He follows the arrows toward the back of the property, where the holler opens up into a natural amphitheater—a flat field with the mountain as a backdrop. Someone's marked out vendor spaces with spray paint. A flatbed trailer serves as a stage, and there's already PA speakers stacked to one side, still wrapped in plastic.

A man in his fifties, Carhartt jacket and UK hat, waves Alex down. Marcus. Alex recognizes him—older, more gray, but same guy who used to run the sound at the high school.

Alex parks and gets out.

"Alex Wilson," Marcus says, walking over with a smile that seems genuine. "Lord, you got tall. I remember when you were running cables for Mr. Henderson's theater class."

"Yes sir," Alex says, shaking his hand. "Appreciate you thinking of me for this."

"Tommy said you've been doing Nashville. How's that treating you?"

"It's treating me," Alex says, which is true enough and not a lie.

Marcus nods like he understands everything Alex didn't say. "Well, we're glad to have you home for a weekend. Let me show you what we're working with."

He walks Alex toward the stage. Two younger guys are unloading more equipment from a truck. "This is Derek and Justin, they're helping with the heavy lifting. You're running point on all the sound stuff—setup, sound check, mixing both days. We got four bands Saturday, three Sunday. Nothing fancy, mostly bluegrass and Americana. You know the drill."

"Yes sir."

"$300 for the weekend, cash, paid out Sunday evening when we wrap. That work?"

Alex's stomach drops but he keeps his face neutral. Sunday evening. Not Saturday night like Tommy said.

"I, uh—" Alex stops. The truth is he needs money today. Tomorrow at the absolute latest. Sunday evening means he can't pay his landlord until Monday morning, which means—

Marcus is watching him, not unkindly. "Something wrong?"

What does Alex say?

---

**Director:** PAUSE - What are Alex's realistic options here? What would happen if he's honest vs if he tries to power through?

**World Engine [OUT OF CHARACTER]:**

**Alex's Options:**

1. **Full Honesty** ("I really needed to get paid tomorrow")
   - **Likely Outcome**: Marcus might be able to do partial advance, but probably not
   - **Consequence**: Looks unprofessional/desperate, might affect how Marcus treats him
   - **Tommy Factor**: Tommy apparently got the details wrong about Saturday payment
   - **Alex Truth**: He literally cannot lie successfully anyway

2. **Partial Truth** ("I've got some bills that are tight, any chance of a partial advance?")
   - **Likely Outcome**: Marcus might give him $100-150 up front
   - **Consequence**: Still might not be enough for landlord, but helps
   - **More Professional**: Frames it as request, not crisis

3. **Power Through** (Say nothing, do the work, deal with landlord situation)
   - **Immediate**: Avoids awkwardness
   - **Problem**: Landlord isn't getting money tomorrow like Alex promised
   - **Cascade**: Eviction proceedings start, more fees, bigger hole
   - **Alex Stress**: Working while this looms would affect performance

4. **Call Tommy** (Step away, get Tommy to fix this somehow)
   - **Tommy's Tools**: Might have cash to loan, might talk to landlord, might have other solution
   - **Dependency**: Leans on Tommy to rescue, again
   - **Reality**: Tommy might not have $870 either

5. **Negotiate Different Terms** (Ask if there's more work he can do for advance payment)
   - **Possible**: Extra work Friday, help with other setup, something
   - **Marcus's Position**: Might not have extra budget, might not have extra work
   - **Long Shot**: But might work

**If Alex is Honest (Most Likely Given Character):**

Marcus will probably:
- Respect the honesty
- Might offer $100-150 advance
- Might have other work Alex can do today
- Might know someone who needs help
- Won't judge too harshly (he knows the struggle)
- But can't solve the whole problem

**The Real Situation:**

Alex needs $870 by tomorrow. This gig pays $300 on Sunday. Even if he gets $150 today, he's still $720 short by tomorrow and won't have the other $150 until Sunday. The math doesn't work no matter what.

He's going to have to:
1. Call landlord and renegotiate timeline (Monday? Tuesday?)
2. Find additional work this weekend
3. Borrow money (Tommy? Someone else?)
4. Some combination of above

**Character Truth:**

Alex can't successfully lie to Marcus about this being fine. His face will show it. He'll crack within an hour of being stressed about it while trying to work.

Honesty is his only real option.

**[END PAUSE - Ready to continue when you are]**

---

**Director:** Alex tells Marcus the truth about needing rent money by tomorrow.

**World Engine:**

Alex looks at the stage, at the equipment, at the mountain behind it. Then back at Marcus.

"I gotta be honest with you, sir. I thought this paid Saturday night, and I've got rent due today in Nashville. I promised my landlord I'd have it by tomorrow." The words come out flat, no performance. Just the situation. "That's on me for not confirming details. I'll still do the work, do it right, but I—I needed you to know that's where my head's at."

Marcus is quiet for a beat, studying Alex's face. Then he nods slowly.

"What's the damage?"

"Eight hundred and seventy dollars. I'm short the whole thing."

"And you drove three hours on empty to make three hundred of it."

"Yes sir."

Marcus pulls off his UK hat, runs a hand through his hair, puts it back on. "I respect you telling me straight. Let me see what I can do." He pulls out his phone, steps away about ten feet, makes a call.

Alex stands there, hands in his pockets, watching Derek and Justin unload speakers. Neither of them looks over—probably didn't hear the conversation.

His phone buzzes. TikTok notification: *Your video "driving home broke" has reached 50,000 views*

Fifty thousand people watched him admit he's broke. None of them are paying his rent.

Marcus comes back. "Okay. Here's what I can do. I can give you $150 now, out of my pocket. You do the work this weekend, I'll give you the other $150 on Sunday instead of the full $300. That's the best I can swing without going back to the festival committee and making it a whole thing."

$150 now. Still $720 short for tomorrow.

"I appreciate that," Alex says. "For real. But I gotta figure out the rest somehow."

Marcus nods. "You know anybody else in the county? Family? Friends who might have work?"

Alex thinks. Tommy's in Nashville. MawMaw's gone. His dad's side of the family stopped talking to him when he left the mines. His mom's side is scattered and broke themselves.

"Not really," he says.

"Well." Marcus reaches for his wallet, pulls out cash. Three fifties. Hands them to Alex. "That's yours now, consider it advance payment. Work or don't work, that's yours. But I'm hoping you stay because I actually do need you and I think you need to be busy this weekend instead of sitting somewhere worrying."

Alex takes the money. Three fifty-dollar bills that solve exactly nothing and mean everything at the same time.

"Thank you," he says, and his voice cracks just slightly on it.

"Come on," Marcus says. "Let's get you some lunch first. You look like you ain't ate in a day."

"Two days," Alex says, honest again.

Marcus shakes his head but he's half-smiling. "Nashville. City of dreams." He starts walking toward the community center. "We got pulled pork left over from yesterday's setup. You eat, then we'll figure out the rest."

What does Alex do?
