## Description
"Last Call This Morning" is a raw and emotionally honest country ballad about heartbreak, regret, and the struggle to let go. The song paints a vivid picture of a man caught between a Friday night's revelry and the harsh reality of Saturday morning, haunted by a lost love. Driven by a relatable narrative and memorable hook, it captures the poignant feeling of clinging to hope when reason dictates otherwise. With its blend of confessional lyrics, catchy melodies, and anthemic choruses, it's a relatable anthem for anyone who's ever wrestled with love and loss.

## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Coffee pot's still brewing from the night before
Sun's creeping through the blinds across my kitchen floor
Work boots by the door, blue jeans on the chair
Smell of last night's whiskey hanging in the air
Got to punch the clock in about an hour
But I'm sitting here thinking 'bout her super power
She could turn my world around with just one smile
Now all that's left is heartache for a while

Chorus:
It's last call this morning, but I ain't going home
Still got her on my mind and I'm drinking alone
Friday night turned into Saturday's shame
It's last call this morning, and I'm still calling her name
Last call this morning

Verse 2:
Pickup truck's still parked outside Murphy's Bar
Tailgate's down, can see it from where my keys are
Bartender said "son, you better call it quits"
But here I am at sunrise, still nursing my fifth
She said she'd be there, underneath those neon lights
Guess she found somebody else to hold her tight
Empty stool and an empty glass, all that's left
Guess our love wasn't meant to last, a cruel test

Chorus:
It's last call this morning, but I ain't going home
Still got her on my mind and I'm drinking alone
Friday night turned into Saturday's shame
It's last call this morning, and I'm still calling her name
Last call this morning

Bridge:
Mama always told me, "boy, don't chase what's gone"
But this heart don't listen when the bottle's this strong
Sun's getting higher, world's waking up
Guess it's time to face the music and give up
Maybe someday the pain will fade away
But today it's just another lonely day

Chorus:
It's last call this morning, but I ain't going home
Still got her on my mind and I'm drinking alone
Friday night turned into Saturday's shame
It's last call this morning, and I'm still calling her name
Last call this morning
Yeah, it's last call this morning

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked in the verses, strummed in the choruses), electric guitar (subtle lead lines and power chords in the choruses), bass guitar (walking bass line during verses, more rhythmic during the choruses), drums (brushes during the verses, full kit during the choruses), pedal steel guitar (provides emotional texture throughout), possibly a Hammond organ subtly in the background during the choruses. 

Tempo: Medium tempo, around 72 BPM. The song should have a slight 'drag' feeling, contributing to the melancholic mood.

Key: G Major (allows for easy guitar chords and a bright, yet slightly mournful sound).

Vocal Delivery: The vocals should be heartfelt and slightly rough around the edges, conveying the narrator's emotional state. Emphasize the vulnerability in the verses and the frustration in the choruses. Consider adding subtle vocal cracks or imperfections to enhance the authenticity. Harmonies in the chorus on the 'calling her name' line would be effective. 

Dynamics: Build dynamics throughout the song, starting with a quiet and intimate verse and gradually building to a more powerful and anthemic chorus. The bridge should be a moment of reflection and vulnerability, before building back to the final chorus.
