## Lyrics

Verse 1
Where the creek whispers secrets through the twisted vines,
And the old oak shadows stretch like forgotten lines.
Mud clings to my heels from the rain-soaked trail,
Echoes of barefoot summers, tales the wind won't fail.

Chorus
Out on the holler where the wild things hide,
Kentucky's whispers in the eventide.
Fireflies weave spells in the twilight haze,
Out on the holler, lost in that maze.
Hey now, holler, let your echoes ring,
Out here in the deep, where the free hearts sing!

Verse 2
Grandpa's ghost fiddle sighs on the evening breeze,
Stories spun from starlight, caught in the sycamore trees.
Chasin' phantom lightning in the meadow's embrace,
Holler's hidden magic, time can't erase.

Chorus
Out on the holler where the wild things hide,
Kentucky's whispers in the eventide.
Fireflies weave spells in the twilight haze,
Out on the holler, lost in that maze.
Hey now, holler, let your echoes ring,
Out here in the deep, where the free hearts sing!

Bridge
When the city's clamor fades like a distant storm,
I chase the holler's call, where my spirit's reborn.
Veins of river secrets, roots tangled deep,
In this woven wonder, my promises keep.

Verse 3
Mama's quilt of memories, stitched with love and care,
A legacy of laughter, hanging in the air.
The porch swing creaks a rhythm, a familiar sound,
Where generations gather, on this hallowed ground.

Chorus
Out on the holler where the wild things hide,
Kentucky's whispers in the eventide.
Fireflies weave spells in the twilight haze,
Out on the holler, lost in that maze.
Hey now, holler, let your echoes ring,
Out here in the deep, where the free hearts sing!

Outro
Yeah, out on the holler, where the mysteries call,
Kentucky's eternal, catchin' us all.
Out on the holler... Home.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked and strummed), fiddle (subtle swells and melodic fills), mandolin (gentle picking, often doubling the fiddle melody), upright bass (provides a warm, grounding pulse), light percussion (hand drums, shaker). The bridge could feature a brief, mournful harmonica solo.
Tempo: Mid-tempo, slightly relaxed. The song should feel unhurried and natural.
Key: G Major (allows for open chords and fiddle-friendly melodies).
Vocal Delivery: Warm, slightly gravelly vocals with a clear Appalachian inflection. Emphasis on storytelling and emotional connection.
Arrangement: Start with acoustic guitar and vocals for Verse 1, gradually adding layers of instrumentation as the song builds towards the choruses. Fiddle and mandolin should complement the vocal melody without overpowering it. The outro can fade out with acoustic guitar and light percussion, leaving a sense of peace and tranquility. Consider adding some very subtle banjo rolls in the background of verse 3, to add additional color. The 'Hey now, holler' section should be sung with a strong, communal feel, possibly with backing vocals joining in.
