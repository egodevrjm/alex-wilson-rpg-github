## Description
A playful yet introspective pop-country ballad blending lightheartedness with genuine regret. At a comfortable 110 BPM in the key of G, the song opens with bright acoustic guitar and banjo, evoking a sunny morning-after scene. Raspy male vocals, reminiscent of Chris Stapleton, deliver vivid verses of a wild night out. The pre-chorus builds with longing, leading into an anthemic chorus filled with lush harmonies and soaring pedal steel. The bridge strips down to a vulnerable acoustic core before launching into a climactic final chorus. The song fades with lingering guitar echoes, fiddle, and diner ambience, leaving the listener with a sense of hopeful resolution and the comforting image of a small-town diner.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Bright acoustic guitar riff with lively banjo plucks in G major, setting a joyful pop-country vibe, like a sunny morning in a messy kitchen)

(Verse 1)
Last night was a whirlwind, shots and two-step spins,
Dancin' on the bar top, raisin' hell with my friends.
Woke up with a headache, crumbs on the floor,
Coffee's brewin' strong, but I'm cravin' more.
Butter meltin' slow on that golden-brown stack,
Laughin' at the memories, ain't lookin' back.

(Pre-Chorus)
Head's poundin' hard, but my heart's still light,
Mornin's gonna save me from that crazy night.

(Chorus - Catchy, upbeat hook with harmonies and fiddle swells)
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's my jam today,
Flaky and buttery, washin' the wild away.
One bite and I'm smilin', forgettin' the ache,
Biscuits and regret, for heaven's sake!
Oh oh, pile 'em high, let the good times roll,
Biscuits and regret, healin' my soul.
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's the cure,
Mornin' after magic, keepin' it pure!

(Verse 2)
Bartender cut us off when the clock struck two,
Stumbled to the truck, lost one damn shoe.
Now I'm at the diner, grease on my plate,
Ethel's biscuits fixin' up my sorry state.
Friends are textin' stories 'bout the night we owned,
Grinnin' through the haze, feelin' right at home.

(Pre-Chorus)
Last night's a blur, but the laughter's clear,
These biscuits pull me back from the frontier.

(Chorus - Bigger build, full band with crowd-ready chants)
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's my jam today,
Flaky and buttery, washin' the wild away.
One bite and I'm smilin', forgettin' the ache,
Biscuits and regret, for heaven's sake!
Oh oh, pile 'em high, let the good times roll,
Biscuits and regret, healin' my soul.
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's the cure,
Mornin' after magic, keepin' it pure!

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic strums and handclaps, then surges)
No shame in the chaos, no tears for the fight,
'Cause a biscuit's redemption makes it all right.
From the barroom blur to the sunrise glow,
This country's cure is the best I know!

(Verse 3)
Ethel's pourin' coffee, says, 'You kids are wild,'
Wipes the counter down, gives me a knowing smile.
Tells a story of her youth, of nights just like this,
Says, 'A little grace and gravy, that's all you need, miss.'
So I slather on the butter, watch it slowly seep,
Into every crack, a promise I can keep.

(Chorus - Massive, joyful finale with whoops and cheers)
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's my jam today,
Flaky and buttery, washin' the wild away.
One bite and I'm smilin', forgettin' the ache,
Biscuits and regret, for heaven's sake!
Oh oh, pile 'em high, let the good times roll,
Biscuits and regret, healin' my soul.
Biscuits and regret, yeah, that's the cure,
Mornin' after magic, keepin' it pure!

(Outro - Fades with banjo riff, echoing "oh oh"s, diner clatter sounds, and a final chuckle)
Biscuits and regret... oh oh, that's my jam!
Mornin' after magic... yeah, here I am!
Biscuits and Regret... ain't life grand?

## Performance Notes

Tempo: 110 BPM, Key: G Major. Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked intro, strummed rhythm), Banjo (lively fills and riffs), Pedal Steel (subtle swells and melodic lines), Fiddle (accents and solos), Drums (light and steady), Bass (walking bass line), Vocals (raspy, soulful male lead with harmonies in the chorus), Backing Vocals (full harmonies in the chorus, simple 'oh oh's in the outro). The bridge should feature prominent hand claps on beats 2 and 4. The song should evoke a feeling of nostalgic warmth and lighthearted fun, despite the lyrical content of 'regret.' Consider adding diner ambience sounds (clattering dishes, quiet chatter) in the intro and outro to enhance the setting. The overall performance style should be energetic but not rushed.
