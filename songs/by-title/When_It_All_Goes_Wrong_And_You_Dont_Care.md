## Description
A raucous, upbeat country-rock anthem about embracing life's inevitable mishaps with a devil-may-care attitude. Driven by a steady, playful rhythm section featuring acoustic guitar, walking bass, and a snappy snare, the song paints a vivid picture of resilience. Fiddle licks add a touch of honky-tonk charm, while electric guitar slides punctuate the choruses with a rebellious energy. Alex Wilson's whiskey-warm, raspy vocals deliver the lyrics with a grin, blending humor and defiance in a way that's both relatable and infectious. Imagine a barroom singalong with a wink, catchy enough for radio play but raw enough to resonate with a honky-tonk crowd.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Flat tire on a Friday, boss cut my pay,
Dog ran off with the neighbor’s stray.
Ex sent a text just to twist the knife,
Bartender says I still owe for last night.

[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m laughin’ louder than the jukebox blare,
Sometimes the wreckage feels like fresh mountain air.

[Chorus]
When it all goes wrong and you don’t care,
You dance in the ashes, toss your worries in the air.
Life’s a wild ride, and the brakes ain’t fair,
So sing it off key like nobody’s there.
When it all goes wrong—hell, you don’t care.

[Verse 2]
Neighbor’s rooster crowin’ at a quarter to noon,
Bank took the Chevy, but I’ll get it back soon.
Poured my last dollar in a neon dream,
Now I’m rich in nothin’ but a damn good scene.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m two steps past the point of repair,
But these busted boots still got a little flair.

[Chorus]
When it all goes wrong and you don’t care,
You dance in the ashes, toss your worries in the air.
Life’s a wild ride, and the brakes ain’t fair,
So sing it off key like nobody’s there.
When it all goes wrong—hell, you don’t care.

[Bridge]
Call it foolish, call it free,
But broken chains still look good on me.
If the sky falls down, I’ll grab a chair,
Toast the thunder rollin’ like a county fair.

[Guitar Solo]

[Final Chorus]
When it all goes wrong and you don’t care,
You dance in the ashes, toss your worries in the air.
Life’s a wild ride, and the brakes ain’t fair,
So sing it off key like nobody’s there.
When it all goes wrong—hell, you don’t care.

[Outro]
Yeah, when it all goes wrong… you just don’t care.
No sir, I just don't care!
(Fade out with a final fiddle lick)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (driving rhythm), electric guitar (slide riffs in choruses, possible twangy solo after the bridge), walking bass line (provides a steady, upbeat groove), snappy snare drum, fiddle (adds honky-tonk flavor with fills and licks), optional: harmonica fills.
Tempo: 120 BPM (keep a steady, driving feel).
Key: G Major (bright and optimistic sound).
Vocals: Delivered with a slightly raspy, 'whiskey-warm' tone. Emphasize the humor and defiance in the lyrics. Harmonies can be added in the choruses for a fuller sound.
Guitar Solo: Keep it relatively short and sweet, focusing on bluesy bends and twangy licks in G Major.
Outro: Fade out the song with a final fiddle lick or guitar twang to leave a lasting impression.
