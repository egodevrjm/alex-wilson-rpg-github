## **54\. Scenario: The TikTok Testament \- The Pikeville Revelation (Age 22\)**

**Setup:** It's late autumn, 2027\. Alex is 22\. Three years have passed since his MawMaw, Judith Wilson, died. On her deathbed, she confirmed the secret she had kept from the world but not from him: she was Rosie Walker, the legendary country star who vanished in 1972\. She entrusted him with her entire hidden legacy: the truth about his grandfather being George Jones, her iconic **1959 Martin D-28 ("Betty")**, a journal of a dozen "burn down Nashville" songs, and a shoebox filled with 50 years of poems. He has honored her wish for secrecy, living a quiet life.

That life has just ended. The Cochran Mine has laid off half its workforce, including both Alex and Tommy. With no savings and bleak job prospects, the pressure is immense. Alex can't live off tips from Murphy's Bar, and he feels a fierce responsibility for Tommy, his ride-or-die best friend who is now also out of work. The secret, once a sacred burden, now looks like the only asset they have left.

**Canon Context:** In this reality, there is no Netflix documentary. The world's only clue about Rosie's fate is a 2020 *Rolling Stone* article that reignited interest in her disappearance but came to no conclusions. Her music is still ubiquitous—a cultural touchstone for generations. Alex is the sole keeper of the answer to one of music's greatest mysteries.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Plan (The TikTok Series):** Alex has decided to tell the entire story on his own terms, through a series of short, direct videos on TikTok. He isn't asking for permission; he's making a declaration.

* **Part 1 (The Hook):** "My Name is Alex Wilson. My Grandmother was Rosie Walker."  
* **Part 2 (The Proof):** Introduce "Betty," her legendary guitar, and show the journal.  
* **Part 3 (The Music):** Perform one of the unreleased, "burn down Nashville" songs.  
* **Part 4 (The Fallout):** Drop the bombshell about his grandfather, George Jones.

**The Stakes:**

* **Upside:** Potential for viral fame, brand deals, a record contract—a financial lifeline for himself and Tommy. The chance to finally tell his grandmother's story on her terms.  
* **Downside:** Unleashing a media firestorm he can't control. Losing his privacy forever. Becoming "Rosie's Grandson" instead of Alex Wilson. The inevitable legal and personal chaos from the Jones estate and the Nashville machine.

**Narrative Tone:** This is not an act of desperation, but a calculated, "hold my beer" dare. Alex is a Chaos Agent. He sees a problem (no money) and is applying a powerful, unpredictable, and potentially explosive solution. His tone should be confident, direct, and infused with the Pikeville charm that makes a shocking declaration feel like an undeniable truth.

### **Opening Scene: The Ghost in the Phone**

**Date:** Wednesday, October 29th, 2027, 11:45 PM **Location:** The main room of MawMaw Judith's old double-wide trailer, Pikeville, KY.

The room is a museum of a quiet life, smelling of old wood, dust, and faint, lingering lavender. It's clean but worn, every object in its place. On the scarred wooden kitchen table sits an open shoebox overflowing with scraps of paper—the "poems." Beside it lies the leather-bound journal, open to a page of defiant, looping script. Leaning against the table is the '59 Martin D-28, "Betty," her wood glowing amber in the dim lamplight.

Alex stands in the center of the room, lit only by the harsh white light of his phone, which is propped up on a stack of old National Geographic magazines. He's wearing a simple, clean grey t-shirt that does nothing to hide the hard lines of a body built by work. He takes a deep breath, runs a hand through his dark hair, and hits record.

He looks directly into the lens, his eyes clear and steady. There’s no script.

"Hey. My name is Alex Wilson. I live here in Pikeville, Kentucky. And up until last week, I was a coal miner. Now... I'm just unemployed."

He gives a small, humorless smile.

"A few years ago, an article came out in *Rolling Stone* asking what happened to the singer Rosie Walker. A lot of people have asked that question for about fifty years. She was my grandmother."

He doesn't pause for effect. He lets the statement hang in the quiet room.

"She didn't die. She didn't disappear. She came home. She changed her name to Judith Wilson, she married a good man, and she raised my father. Then she raised me. She never sang another note in public, but she never stopped writing."

He gestures to the table. The camera stays on his face.

"She left me everything. Her songs. Her poems. Her story." He reaches off-screen and his hand comes back holding the Martin by the neck, bringing the iconic, road-worn guitar into the frame.

"And she left me Betty."

He looks back at the lens, his expression shifting from a statement of fact to a challenge.

"Everyone knows the songs she released. But nobody knows the songs she wrote after she burned Nashville to the ground on her way out the door. I'm gonna be sharing her story. The real one. And I'm gonna be playing her songs. The real ones."

He stops the recording. The small trailer is silent again. On the screen, the video waits. The button glows: **POST**. The whole world is one thumb press away.
