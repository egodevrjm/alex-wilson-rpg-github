2. **The Independent Label:** His hero, a legendary and fiercely independent artist (like a Jason Isbell or Sturgill Simpson type), has offered to partner with him to start a new, artist-owned record label. It would be a financial struggle, a constant grind, and he'd be turning his back on mainstream stardom. But it would give him complete creative freedom for the rest of his life.

**The Final Choice:** He has one week to decide. The choice will define his legacy. Will he be an entertainer or an artist? Rich or free?

**Scene opens:** Alex is standing on the porch of the small cabin outside Nashville he finally bought. The Vegas contract, a document as thick as a phone book, is on the table inside. His phone rings. It's the independent artist. "So, what do you say, kid?" he asks. "You want to go build something real, or you wanna go play dress-up for the tourists?" From the road, Alex can see the faint glow of the Nashville skyline. He thinks of Pikeville, of the mine, of his grandmother hiding from the very fame he now holds in his hands. \[What does he say?\]

## 51\. Scenario: The Ghost of Blackberry Creek (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's late August, 2023\. Alex is 18\. His abusive father, David, drank himself to death a month ago. With no other family, Alex is utterly alone. He's retreated to the one place he feels safe: the stretch of Blackberry Creek behind his father's derelict trailer. He is practically feral, living off the land—trapping, fishing, and tending a small garden. He is self-sufficient, silent, and entirely separate from the world.

His only companion is a beat-up workhorse guitar he saved for years to buy. He's never played for another living soul. Every evening, as the sun sets, he sits on a flat rock by the water and plays the songs he's been writing since he was a boy. It's not a performance; it's a ritual. It's how he breathes.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Catalyst:** Liam Hayes, a veteran journalist for *Rolling Stone*, and Sarah Jenkins, a celebrated photographer, are in Pikeville for a generic feature on "The Enduring Spirit of Appalachian Music." They're bored, the story is cliché, and they're about to wrap it up. On their last day, looking for some final B-roll shots of nature, they follow a small path down to Blackberry Creek.

**The Discovery:** Through the trees, they see him. A young man who looks like a forgotten god, shirtless, with muscles carved from work, not a gym. He's sitting on a rock, singing a song that stops them both in their tracks. His voice is a raw, beautiful ache—pure, untrained, and devastatingly honest. Sarah raises her camera instinctively, the telephoto lens capturing images that she knows, with a jolt, are career-defining. Liam quietly turns on his field recorder.

They approach him after the song. Alex, startled and wary, is disarmingly polite. He has no idea what *Rolling Stone* is and assumes they're just friendly hikers. He answers their questions with a simple, unguarded honesty, telling them about his dad, the creek, and how the songs are "just something to do so the quiet don't get too loud." They spend an hour with him, then leave. Alex forgets about them the next day.

**The Fallout (Three Weeks Later):** Liam Hayes scraps the puff piece. He writes a passionate, almost mythic cover story about the "Ghost of Blackberry Creek." Sarah Jenkins' photos are breathtaking. The editors at *Rolling Stone* know they have something extraordinary. They put him on the cover.

**The Headline:** **"MEET ALEX WILSON: The Greatest Singer Alive is an 18-Year-Old Orphan Living by a Creek in Kentucky"**

### **Opening Scene: The World Finds Alex**

**Date:** September 21, 2023, 11:15 AM **Location:** Murphy's Bar, Pikeville, KY

The screen door of Murphy’s Bar groans open and bangs shut. Alex squints as his eyes adjust to the dim, beer-scented interior. He hasn't been to town in two weeks. He sets a bundle of cleaned catfish on the bar.

"Eddie," he says, his voice raspy from disuse. "Need to trade for some salt and flour."

Eddie Murphy, who has known Alex his whole life and slipped him free meals as a kid, is about to answer when the door slams open again. It’s Tommy Harlan's dad, holding a magazine like it's a winning lottery ticket.

"Eddie, you seen this? Holy God, you seen this?" He slaps the magazine down on the bar, right next to the fish.

Alex glances at it. On the cover is a photograph of him. He’s shirtless, sitting on his rock by the creek, eyes closed, head tilted back as if in prayer or pain. The sunlight hits the water behind him, making it sparkle like diamonds. He looks impossibly beautiful and completely lost. Above the iconic red logo, the headline screams at him.

Eddie stares from the magazine cover to the quiet, dusty boy standing in front of him. "Alex... what in the hell is this?"

"I... I don't know," Alex says, genuinely confused. He touches the glossy paper. "They were just some people. They were nice. They said they liked my song."

The old rotary phone behind the bar starts to ring, shrill and insistent. Eddie ignores it. He opens the magazine. The first page is a two-page spread of another of Sarah’s photos—a close-up of Alex’s face, haunted and intense.

"It says here," Eddie reads, his voice a stunned whisper, "that you're 'a phantom... a voice that America has been waiting for without knowing it.' It says you might be the most important artist of your generation."

The phone continues its frantic ringing. Now Eddie's cell on the counter starts buzzing, vibrating against a beer stein. A couple of old-timers at a corner table are staring, whispering. One of them pulls out his phone, taps the screen, and his jaw drops.

"It's everywhere," the man says. "It's on the news."

Alex feels a cold dread creep up his spine. The photo, the words, the ringing phones—it feels like an invasion. Those people hadn't been nice; they had been hunting. They took the one thing that was his, the one private thing in his world, and they showed it to everyone. His sanctuary was now a headline.

He backs away from the bar. "I gotta go," he mumbles, his throat tight.

"Wait, kid\!" Eddie calls out, but Alex is already pushing the door open, desperate for the familiar quiet of the trees. He runs out into the glaring sunlight, heading for the woods.

But this time, the world knew exactly where he was running.
