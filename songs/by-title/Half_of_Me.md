## Description
A deeply personal and evocative Americana ballad, "Half of Me" explores the complexities of conditional love and self-acceptance. Built upon a foundation of Travis-picked acoustic guitar in D minor, the song weaves a tapestry of Appalachian sounds, featuring haunting fiddle melodies, subtle pedal steel textures, and a driving rhythm section that builds from intimate introspection to powerful declaration. Alex Wilson's close-mic'd vocals convey raw emotion, culminating in a powerful key change to E minor in the final chorus. The song's journey from quiet vulnerability to defiant strength resonates with anyone who has felt the sting of partial acceptance and the triumph of embracing their complete self.

## Lyrics

[Intro - Fingerpicked acoustic guitar in D minor, slow and sparse, like raindrops on tin]

[Verse 1]
They want the calluses but not the scars beneath
Want the Sunday sermon, not the Saturday grief
Love my voice at sunrise, hate it when it breaks
Want the mountain honey, not the copperhead snakes
They want my strong shoulders when their load gets heavy
But turn away when mine start to shake
Want these hands for building, not for what they've buried
Want the give but never what it takes

[Chorus]
You can't love half of me
And leave the rest to die
Can't pick the roses growing wild
And curse the thorns that make 'em right
I'm the coal dust and the diamond
The thunder and the rain
You can't love half of me
The darkness makes the flame

[Verse 2]
Want my mama's recipes but not her empty chair
Want the fiddle music, not the funeral prayer
They love my bootstraps, hate hearing 'bout the holes
Want the preservation jar but not what's been preserved in my soul
They want the revelation, not the years of doubt
Want the healing water, not the poison well
Want to hear redemption but not what I'm redeemed from
Want the heaven but won't walk through my hell

[Chorus]
You can't love half of me
And leave the rest to die
Can't pick the roses growing wild
And curse the thorns that make 'em right
I'm the coal dust and the diamond
The thunder and the rain
You can't love half of me
The darkness makes the flame

[Bridge - Music drops to just guitar and voice, building slowly]
I am my father's fists and my mother's grace
Every scar that marked me, every saving embrace
I'm the boy who hid beneath the floorboards singing
And the man who learned to stand and face
(Everything that tried to break me)
(Made me who you see today)

[Final Chorus - Full arrangement, key change up to E minor]
So love all of me
Or set this whole thing free
These mountain bones weren't made to bend
To fit what you need me to be
I'm the whiskey and the water
The sinner and the saint
You can't love half of me
The darkness makes the flame
No, you can't love half of me
The darkness makes... the flame

[Outro - Return to fingerpicked guitar, slowing, ending on an unresolved suspended chord]

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (Travis picking style), Fiddle, Pedal Steel, Upright Bass, Brushed Drums, Piano (sparse droplets in the bridge), Lead Vocal.
Tempo: Moderate, around 72 BPM, with subtle pushes and pulls in timing for emotional emphasis.
Key: D minor (verses, choruses), E minor (final chorus).
Arrangement: The song builds gradually. The intro and first verse are sparse, featuring only acoustic guitar and vocals. Fiddle responds to vocal phrases, adding a haunting quality. Pedal steel enters subtly in the first chorus, adding a wash of color. Verse 2 introduces upright bass and brushed drums, creating a gentle, driving rhythm. The bridge strips the arrangement back to guitar and voice, building intensity towards the final chorus. The key change to E minor in the final chorus adds significant emotional impact. The outro returns to the sparse intimacy of the intro, leaving the listener with a sense of lingering vulnerability. The suspended chord at the end creates a feeling of unresolved tension, hinting at the ongoing struggle for self-acceptance. Consider using a Dm9 for the unresolved outro chord.
Production Notes: Focus on capturing a warm, intimate sound. Use close-miking techniques for the vocals and acoustic guitar to emphasize the song's personal nature. Experiment with reverb and delay to create a sense of space and depth, particularly on the fiddle and pedal steel. Ensure the upright bass has a clear, defined tone to anchor the rhythm section. The brushed drums should be subtle and supportive, avoiding any harsh or aggressive sounds.
