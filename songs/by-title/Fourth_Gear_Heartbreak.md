The song blends introspective lyrics with an upbeat tempo, creating a bittersweet atmosphere of heartbreak and resilience.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Got my tackle box and my old fishing pole
Trying to fill up this empty hole
She left me sitting on this front porch swing
With a cooler full of beer and a diamond ring
Truck's been sitting in the drive all week
Radio's playing songs that make me weak

[Chorus]
It's a fourth gear heartbreak, pedal to the floor
Can't outrun the memory of what we had before
Eighty-eight on the dashboard, tears in my eyes
Fourth gear heartbreak, but I can't say goodbye
Fourth gear heartbreak, running out of road
Fourth gear heartbreak, got nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
Cast my line out in the morning light
Thinking 'bout her hair and how it felt so right
Empty beer cans scattered 'round my feet
This old porch creaks to a lonesome beat
Neighbors probably think I've lost my mind
Sitting here trying to leave the past behind

[Chorus]
It's a fourth gear heartbreak, pedal to the floor
Can't outrun the memory of what we had before
Eighty-eight on the dashboard, tears in my eyes
Fourth gear heartbreak, but I can't say goodbye
Fourth gear heartbreak, running out of road
Fourth gear heartbreak, got nowhere to go

[Bridge]
Maybe tomorrow I'll put it in drive
Find a new reason to feel alive
But tonight I'm stuck in this same old place
With her lipstick kiss still on my face
This bottle's almost empty, just like my soul
Guess that's the price you pay when love takes its toll

[Chorus]
It's a fourth gear heartbreak, pedal to the floor
Can't outrun the memory of what we had before
Eighty-eight on the dashboard, tears in my eyes
Fourth gear heartbreak, but I can't say goodbye
Fourth gear heartbreak, running out of road
Fourth gear heartbreak, got nowhere to go

[Outro]
Fourth gear heartbreak, got nowhere to go
Fourth gear heartbreak, oh, oh, oh

## Performance Notes

Tempo: Moderate, but with a driving feel, emphasizing the 'fourth gear' metaphor. Instrumentation: Primarily acoustic guitar-driven, with a prominent 808 bass drum and snare to give it a modern edge. Layer in some subtle banjo or mandolin for texture. Add electric guitar riffs during the choruses to build intensity. Harmonies in the chorus are essential for a full sound. Key: G Major or E Major (depending on Alex's vocal range - both would work well with country instrumentation). Bridge: The bridge should be slightly quieter and more introspective, building back up to the final chorus. A steel guitar solo could be a great addition here. Pay close attention to the dynamics to create a contrast between the verses and the chorus. The outro fades out slowly with the 808 pulse and some layered vocal harmonies on 'oh, oh, oh'.
