# Integration Guidance for New Locales & Genres

## Deployment Strategy
1. Introduce a new locale with 1–2 concrete nouns immediately (venue, street, gear).
2. Within three narrative beats of any “win” (good gig, positive meeting) inject a friction element (logistics, finance, interpersonal).
3. Reset social proof when entering a new city: follower growth and venue access drop a tier until re‑established.
4. Financial Pressure: NYC/London lodging escalates stress → drives decisions (couch surfing vs. extra shifts).
5. Sync vs. Artistic Tension: When a sync opportunity appears, surface trade‑offs (lyric changes, mix stems due overnight).

## Mechanical Hooks (If Using 2d6 System)
| Situation | Suggested Check | Failure / Partial Consequence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Last‑minute stem export | Mind + Grit | Corrupt file; pay for rush engineer |
| Negotiating earlier curfew slot | Social | Reduced set length or unfavorable split |
| Weather impacting busking income | Grit | Lower tip yield; increased wear on instrument |
| Cross‑town gear haul in LA traffic | Body | Arrive late; lose prime soundcheck slot |
| Clearing sample for drill track | Mind | Higher publishing share concession |

## Consistency with Existing Realism Rules
* Specificity > generic: Keep brand, venue, gear names front‑loaded.
* Mixed results pacing: Avoid consecutive scenes of unbroken success.
* Authentic consequence: Legal, financial, social ripples tracked (late fees, reputation changes, trust shifts).
* Consent & respect remain mandatory in interpersonal dynamics.

## Linking Back to Core Guide
Embed references from original world guide (e.g., A&R expectations, social metrics) when characters request advancement (playlist adds, label showcase). Cross‑cite Nashville baseline income to highlight cost delta in NYC or London.

## Quick Checklist Before Finalizing a Scene

- [ ] Included one sensory layer (smell, texture, ambient sound).
- [ ] Introduced or escalated a friction element.
