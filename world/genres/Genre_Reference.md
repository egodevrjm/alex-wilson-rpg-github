## Genre Production / Workflow Friction
* Drill: Last‑minute verse request; engineer must re‑print stems before curfew.
* EDM: Festival set time trimmed 10 minutes; reorder drops live.
* Americana: Fiddle intonation drift in humid afternoon set—retune vs. energy loss.
* K‑Pop (if used): Choreo revision invalidates camera blocking pre‑viz; re‑shoot scheduling crunch.

## Cross‑Genre Authenticity Cues
1. Vocabulary Specificity – “Print a -10 LUFS pre‑master,” “sidechain the pad,” “comp the doubles.”
2. Platform Differences – Folk: Bandcamp Friday spikes; Drill: YouTube reaction channels; Grime: community radio co‑sign.
3. Fashion / Style – Grime: puffer jacket + cracked AirPods case; Americana: patched denim; Pop camp: athleisure + ring light.
4. Time-of-Day Patterns – Film scoring rewrites at 7:00 AM; techno producers exporting after dawn; Nashville co‑writes 11:00 sharp; LA pop sessions “2 PM” (real tracking 4:30).
