## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with that restless feeling
Like I been hiding underneath my skin
Mama always said "Boy, keep your head down"
But I'm tired of blending with the wind
Got my boots laced up and my heart wide open
Gonna step into the light today
'Cause if they're gonna see me anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm done with playing small
Done with fading into walls

[Chorus]
Might as well shine, might as well glow
Might as well let the whole world know
I'm here, I'm alive, I'm ready to fly
If I'm gonna be seen, might as well shine
Might as well shine, might as well be
Everything I was born to be
No more hiding behind these lines
Might as well shine, might as well shine

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around like I was sorry
For taking up space in this old town
But something in my bones started moving
Like a goal post calling my name out loud
So I kicked that fear right through the uprights
Watched it disappear into the sky
Now tomorrow's knocking at my door tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm done with playing small
Done with fading into walls

[Chorus]
Might as well shine, might as well glow
Might as well let the whole world know
I'm here, I'm alive, I'm ready to fly
If I'm gonna be seen, might as well shine
Might as well shine, might as well be
Everything I was born to be
No more hiding behind these lines
Might as well shine, might as well shine

[Bridge]
Every scar, every bruise, every tear I've cried
Led me here to this moment where I come alive
No more shadows, no more shame
Time to dance inside the rain

[Chorus]
Might as well shine, might as well glow
Might as well let the whole world know
I'm here, I'm alive, I'm ready to fly
If I'm gonna be seen, might as well shine
Might as well shine, might as well be
Everything I was born to be
No more hiding behind these lines
Might as well shine, might as well shine

[Outro]
Might as well shine, might as well shine
Might as well shine, for all the world to see

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (steel-string), electric guitar (with a slight twang), bass guitar, drums (with a driving beat), and potentially a banjo or mandolin to emphasize the Appalachian influence. Layered harmonies in the chorus would enhance the anthemic feel.
Tempo: Medium tempo, building in intensity throughout the song. The bridge should create a moment of vulnerability before the powerful final chorus.
Dynamics: Start relatively quiet in the verses, building to a full sound in the chorus. The bridge should be a dynamic contrast before the final chorus. 
Production: A modern pop-country sound with clean vocals, polished instrumentation, and a driving rhythm section.
Key Change: A half-step or whole-step key change for the final chorus to amplify the sense of liberation and empowerment.
Performance: The song should be performed with conviction and energy. Alex should connect with the audience and convey the raw emotion of the lyrics. Encourage audience participation during the chorus to create a sense of collective empowerment.
