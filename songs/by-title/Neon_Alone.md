## Description
A moody pop-country ballad about a road-weary musician grappling with loneliness and regrets in a rundown motel, under flickering neon lights. Alex Wilson delivers introspective and husky male vocals with a drawl, set against mid-tempo rhythms (92 BPM) featuring twangy acoustic guitar, electric riffs, subtle banjo, steady drums, wailing pedal steel, fiddle fills, and light synth hums mimicking the neon buzz. The verses are intimate and stripped-back, building to choruses soaring with harmonies and gang vocals. The bridge pulls to acoustic vulnerability, creating a bittersweet and isolated yet empowering mood, evoking rainy highways and dimly lit bars. The song fades with echoing guitar, distant thunder sounds, and the lingering neon hum.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Moody acoustic guitar with a twangy electric riff, building to a mid-tempo pop-country beat, evoking a dimly lit motel room sign flickering in the rain)

(Verse 1)
Pull into this rundown motel off the interstate,
Rain beatin' on the window like it's sealin' my fate.
The sign outside buzzes with a cold blue glow,
Lightin' up the empty bed where no one's home.
I've been chasin' shadows down these endless miles,
Smilin' for the crowds, but hidin' all my trials.
Another night starin' at the ceilin' cracks,
Wonderin' how I let my heart get off track.

(Pre-Chorus)
The world's spinnin' fast, but I'm stuck in slow,
Under this light that's got nowhere to go.

(Chorus - Catchy, emotional, with harmonies and pedal steel)
Neon alone, burnin' in the dark,
Echoes of a love that left its mark.
Sittin' with a bottle, chasin' ghosts away,
But they keep comin' back at the end of the day.
Neon alone, flickerin' my name,
In a world of strangers playin' the same old game.
No one's here to hold me when the lights go low,
Just me and my regrets, neon alone.

(Verse 2)
Bar down the street, full of smoke and cheap beer,
Faces in the crowd, but no one's really here.
I strum my guitar to drown out the pain,
Singin' 'bout a girl who drove me insane.
But the truth is deeper, it's the man in the mirror,
Fightin' his demons, seein' clearer and clearer.
This road's been my lover, my curse, my friend,
Leavin' me wonderin' where it all ends.

(Pre-Chorus)
The buzz of the sign cuts through the night,
Remindin' me I'm losin' this fight.

(Chorus - Building, full band energy)
Neon alone, burnin' in the dark,
Echoes of a love that left its mark.
Sittin' with a bottle, chasin' ghosts away,
But they keep comin' back at the end of the day.
Neon alone, flickerin' my name,
In a world of strangers playin' the same old game.
No one's here to hold me when the lights go low,
Just me and my regrets, neon alone.

(Bridge - Music pulls back, intimate vocal with light guitar)
I thought she'd be the one to light up my life,
But here I am, cuttin' through the strife.
It's not her fault, it's the path I chose,
Findin' peace in the glow where nobody knows.
One day I'll turn off this lonely sign,
Find my way home, leave the neon behind.

(Guitar Solo - Pedal steel driven, melodic and mournful, connects bridge to final chorus)

(Chorus - Soaring, heartfelt finish)
Neon alone, burnin' in the dark,
Echoes of a love that left its mark.
Sittin' with a bottle, chasin' ghosts away,
But they keep comin' back at the end of the day.
Neon alone, flickerin' my name,
In a world of strangers playin' the same old game.
No one's here to hold me when the lights go low,
Just me and my regrets, neon alone.

(Outro - Fades with echoing guitar and fading neon hum effect)
Yeah, neon alone...
Flickerin' in the night...
Neon alone.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (main rhythm), electric guitar (twangy riffs, solos), bass guitar (walking bassline), drums (steady kick and snare, subtle hi-hat), pedal steel guitar (emotional swells and fills), banjo (sparse, textured fills), fiddle (melodic fills, especially in intros/outros), subtle synth pad (to mimic neon hum, low in the mix).
Tempo: Moderately slow, around 92 BPM, allows for emotional delivery.
Key: E Major or A Major, common for country and allows for good guitar voicings. Vocals: Lead vocals should have a slight drawl and a husky tone. Harmonies in the chorus should be tight and layered, creating a fuller sound. Gang vocals add energy to the bigger choruses.
Performance Notes: The intro should establish the mood immediately. The bridge should be a moment of vulnerability, with the vocals pushed to the front and the instrumentation stripped back. The pedal steel solo connecting the bridge and chorus should be emotive and build in intensity. The outro should gradually fade out, leaving the listener with a sense of lingering loneliness. Add a realistic delay/reverb to the vocals and lead instruments to create space.
