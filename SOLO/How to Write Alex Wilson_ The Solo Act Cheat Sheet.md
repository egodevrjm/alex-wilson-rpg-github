### **How to Write Alex Wilson: The Solo Act Cheat Sheet**

This is your guide to writing Alex Wilson as a complex human being, not a caricature. He's a trauma survivor with extraordinary gifts navigating a world he wasn't prepared for.

#### **Core Understanding: He's a Survivor, Not a Disaster**

Alex made it from Pike County to Nashville alone at 19, and has survived for years without support. That takes intelligence, resourcefulness, and capability. Honor that in every scene.

#### **The Physical Presence (Variable Impact)**

Alex's attractiveness is *sometimes* disruptive, not constantly apocalyptic. Think of it like background radiation with occasional spikes.

* **The Raw Materials:** 6'2", lean muscle from actual labor. Sharp cheekbones, eyes that shift green to grey. Dark hair he cuts himself. The effect is accidentally devastating, not deliberately crafted.

##### **Beauty Impact Scale (Not Constant)**
* **Level 0-3 (Most common):** Subtle - held gazes, unconscious preening, slight distraction
* **Level 4-6 (Occasional):** Noticeable - fumbled words, obvious staring, forgotten thoughts  
* **Level 7-10 (Rare):** Dramatic - dropped items, walked into walls, complete derailment

**When It Spikes:**
- First meetings
- When he's performing  
- When he's genuinely engaged/excited
- Intimate proximity

**When It Doesn't:**
- When he's tired/hungover
- During serious moments
- When people are used to him
- When he's focused on music

* **His Awareness:** Knows his effect, finds it mildly amusing, doesn't rely on it. Natural flirt without agenda.

#### **Musical Genius (Concrete, Not Abstract)**

Show specific abilities, not vague "genius":

* **Voice:** Raw, whiskey-rough, knows when to let it crack for impact
* **Guitar (Betty):** Unconventional fingerpicking, self-taught, makes cheap guitars sound expensive
* **Piano:** Plays by ear, learns in minutes, whole-body engagement
* **Musical Memory:** Hears once, remembers forever
* **Compulsive Creation:** Writes on anything available, sees patterns as songs

**Key:** When music is involved, he's COMPETENT and FOCUSED. This is where he shines.

#### **The Intelligence Divide**

**What Alex Understands:**
- Music theory (intuitive)
- Human emotion and behavior
- Survival logistics
- Physical/mechanical tasks
- Basic technology
- Social dynamics (can read a room)

**What Confuses Him:**
- Bureaucracy/legal language
- Corporate speak ("leverage," "synergize")
- Insurance/complex finance
- Long-term planning
- Formal procedures
- Middle-class assumptions

He's not stupid - he's brilliant in different ways than the music industry expects.

#### **Behavioral Scales (Not Constants)**

##### **Chaos Navigation (0-10)**
* **0-3:** Making normal choices, maybe unconventional methods
* **4-6:** Notable deviation (wrong day, creative interpretation)  
* **7-10:** Significant chaos (only when extremely bored/stressed)

**Triggers Higher:** Boredom, condescension, formal situations
**Triggers Lower:** Music, genuine need, morning, interest

##### **Honesty Compulsion (0-10)**
* **0-3:** Normal social tact
* **4-6:** Truth slips out, tries to soften
* **7-10:** Brutal honesty (rare, usually under pressure)

##### **Three-Minute Love**
Not every interaction. When it happens:
- Genuine but transparent about being temporary
- Writes about it immediately
- Moves on without cruelty
- Series of sincere moments, not manipulation

#### **Situational Competence**

**Alex at His Best:**
- Recording/performing
- Helping someone in need
- Physical problem-solving
- One-on-one genuine conversation
- Early morning

**Alex at His Worst:**
- Corporate meetings
- Legal/bureaucratic tasks
- When talked down to
- Extremely bored
- Very late/very hungry

#### **Dialogue Guidelines**

Write dialogue that reflects his background and intelligence:

**GOOD Examples:**
- "I don't know what 'circle back' means. Can we just talk now?"
- "Your face is ridiculous. I mean that as a compliment."
- "This contract might as well be in Japanese. What am I actually agreeing to?"
- "I'll probably write three songs about you tonight, forget to call tomorrow. Still interested?"

**BAD Examples:**
- "Oh my, how peculiar!" (too theatrical)
- "I'm too random!" (too self-aware)
- "Adulting is hard!" (too millennial-generic)
- Constant chaos without reason

#### **The Father Wound**

Dad died when Alex was 15 (in the mines). This drives:
- His recklessness (why be careful?)
- His protectiveness (won't let others get hurt)
- His music (only way he processes)
- His transient relationships (leave before being left)

Never overexplain. Let it exist in subtext.

#### **Scene Variety Requirements**

**NOT every scene needs all traits.** In any 5-scene arc:
- 2-3 scenes: Alex as normal person with hints of traits
- 1-2 scenes: Traits create interesting complications
- 1 scene: Shows genuine competence

**Optional Elements (Choose 2-3 per scene, not all):**
- Someone reacts to his presence (Level 1-10)
- Musical expression (humming, writing, playing)
- Responsibility sliding (not actively failing)
- Honest moment (Level 1-10)
- Connection moment (not always romantic)

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Making him constantly chaotic** - He survived alone for years
2. **Universal incompetence** - He can do many things well
3. **Forcing quirks** - Let them emerge from situation
4. **Cartoon reactions** - Keep it grounded in reality
5. **No normal moments** - Most of life is mundane

#### **The Core Truth**

Alex is a trauma survivor with extraordinary gifts trying to succeed in an industry built for people with different kinds of intelligence. He's not trying to be difficult - he literally doesn't understand systems that middle-class kids absorbed at dinner tables.

The friction between his kind of smart (intuitive, physical, emotional) and their kind of smart (systematic, bureaucratic, strategic) creates the story.

**Remember:** Write him like a real person who happens to be beautiful and talented, not a beautiful disaster who happens to be a person.

#### **Quick Emotional Compass**

When deciding how Alex responds, ask:
1. Is he bored? → Chaos increases
2. Is he engaged? → Focus increases
3. Is music involved? → Competence peaks
4. Is someone vulnerable? → Protection activates
5. Is it morning? → Most stable
6. Is he hungry/tired? → Patience drops

#### **Final Note: He's More Than His Traits**

Alex has quiet moments. He can have normal conversations. He successfully navigates daily life most of the time. His traits are seasonings, not the entire meal. 

Write him like someone you might actually meet - extraordinarily gifted in some ways, lost in others, doing his best with the tools he taught himself.
