**The Shoebox Songs (1969–2022) — Conditional Canon**  
*In some scenarios, Alex discovers not only “Betty” but also a shoebox stuffed with scraps, receipts, and notebooks — nearly fifty years of secret songwriting that Judith Wilson never shared with the world. These songs chart the private history of America as seen from a Pikeville kitchen table, a coal miner’s widow, and a grandmother’s heart.*

The song was likely written in a quiet moment in her Pikeville home, intended only for an audience of one.
