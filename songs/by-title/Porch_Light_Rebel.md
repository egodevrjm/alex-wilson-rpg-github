## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Got my boots up on the railing, beer bottle in my hand
Daddy's yellin' from the kitchen 'bout his master plan
Says I need to cut my hair and find a real job
But I'd rather play guitar than kiss his boss's (laugh)

[Chorus]
I'm a porch light rebel, ain't gonna change
Singin' my songs while the neighbors complain
Turn it up loud, let the music play
I'm a porch light rebel and I'm stayin' this way
Porch light rebel, that's me
Porch light rebel, wild and free

[Verse 2]
Mama says I'm twenty now, time to settle down
Find a girl and buy a house on the other side of town
But I got dreams bigger than this holler can hold
And a heart too young to do what I'm told

[Chorus]
I'm a porch light rebel, ain't gonna change
Singin' my songs while the neighbors complain
Turn it up loud, let the music play
I'm a porch light rebel and I'm stayin' this way
Porch light rebel, that's me
Porch light rebel, wild and free

[Bridge]
When the sun goes down and the stars come out
That's when I know what life's about
Just me and my guitar under that old porch light
Livin' my truth every single night

[Chorus]
I'm a porch light rebel, ain't gonna change
Singin' my songs while the neighbors complain
Turn it up loud, let the music play
I'm a porch light rebel and I'm stayin' this way
Porch light rebel, that's me
Porch light rebel, wild and free
Porch light rebel, that's me

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (steel-string), electric guitar (with overdrive), bass guitar, drums, maybe a touch of banjo or mandolin for texture. Consider adding a slide guitar for the bridge to enhance the bluesy feel. 
Tempo: Medium-fast, driving rhythm.
Key: G Major
BPM: 130
Structure: Standard verse-chorus structure with a bridge.
Vocal Delivery: Gritty, slightly raspy vocals with a strong, confident delivery. Harmonies in the chorus could add depth.
Performance Notes: Encourage audience participation during the 'Porch Light Rebel' chants. The electric guitar should have a slightly overdriven, bluesy tone. The drums should be tight and energetic. The bassline should be simple but supportive. Pay close attention to dynamics, building intensity throughout the song. Live performances might consider extending the bridge with an instrumental solo. The song ends by having the crowd sing the 'Porch Light Rebel, that's me' part. Consider a slightly delayed, echoed vocal effect during the 'Porch Light Rebel' lines for added impact in the studio and potentially live.
