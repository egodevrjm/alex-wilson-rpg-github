# Los Angeles Music Ecosystem

## Core Identity
Los Angeles is a collision of mainstream pop, hip‑hop, songwriter camps, sync/film scoring, legacy rock and creator culture. Days fragment into car commutes, late‑night sessions and “casual” coffees that are really vetting meetings.

## Major Label & Corporate Presence
* **Capitol Music Group (Hollywood Tower)** – Pop/A&R showcase rooms with branded neon; lobby smell: espresso + polished marble.
* **Interscope Geffen A&M (Santa Monica)** – Hybrid pop/hip‑hop hub; reception wall of platinum plaques; interns hauling Pelican cases.
* **Atlantic / Warner / Elektra West Coast offices** – Glass conference rooms; LED dashboards of stream counts.
* **Disney Music Group / Hollywood Records (Burbank)** – Film/TV synergy; cafeteria lines with voice actors practicing lines under their breath.
* **Concord (Santa Monica)**, **Primary Wave (Beverly Hills)** – Catalog exploitation meetings about “re‑imagined” trailer versions.

## Power Nodes & Gatekeepers
* **Producer / Writer Camps** – Rented Airbnbs in Laurel Canyon / Hollywood Hills; whiteboards with three columns: Concept / Tempo / Hook Words.
* **Music Supervisors** – Frequent the **Hotel Café** or East Hollywood showcases; 1:00 AM emails: “Need a 90‑sec alt mix by morning—can you strip the vocal?”
* **Sync Houses** – Deliver briefs: “Billie Eilish‑adjacent but uplifting, 105 BPM, no explicit lyrics”; NDAs thick as screenplays.

## Influential Studios
| Studio | Hallmarks | Vibe Cue |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sunset Sound** | Classic rock lineage (Prince, Van Halen) | Smell of old wood + ozone of tube amps |
| **Henson Studios** | Jim Henson heritage | Kermit statuettes, manicured courtyards |
| **Capitol Studios** | Iconic echo chambers | Lobby tourists, hushed staff |
| **EastWest** | Orchestral rooms | Rolling string carts, film score callsheets |
| **Sound City (Van Nuys)** | Grit + analog lore | Burnt coffee, duct‑taped mic stands |

## Venues & Tiers
* **Early Stage / Showcase** – **Hotel Café (Room 1 & 2)**, **The Mint**, **Moroccan Lounge**, **Adults Only** (speakeasy bar with bookcase entrance).
* **Indie & Mid‑Tier** – **The Roxy**, **Troubadour**, **Echoplex/Echo**, **El Rey**, **Teragram Ballroom**.
* **Iconic / Large** – **Hollywood Bowl** (picnic baskets, distant sirens), **Greek Theatre** (pine smell on hillside), **Kia Forum**, **SoFi Stadium**.
* **Scene Micro‑Signals** – Sticky bar rails at the Echo; narrow backstage stair at the Troubadour; Roxy load‑in curb chaos (parking citation threat).

## Neighborhood Texture
| Neighborhood | Creative Function | Sensory Anchor |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Silver Lake** | Indie alt, bedroom pop | Sunrise joggers + kombucha taps |
| **Echo Park** | DIY, experimental | Mural alleys, skateboard wheels clacking |
| **North Hollywood (NoHo)** | Dance rehearsals, session singers | Distant sub‑bass + sweaty rehearsal floors |
| **Burbank** | Corporate media + composers | Security gates, badge scanners beeping |
| **Hollywood Hills / Laurel Canyon** | High‑end writing retreats | Citrus trees, quiet after 2 AM |
| **Downtown (Arts District)** | Electronic, visual collabs | Warehouse air: dust + aerosol paint |

## Scheduling Friction Examples
* 11:00 AM “coffee” (actually pre‑pitch) → 2:00 PM edit pass → 6:30 PM showcase → 11:45 PM topline sprint → 3:10 AM bounce export fails.
* Drive time on the 101 erases promised “quick” gear swap.
* Noise complaint at midnight: forced switch to headphones, vocalist loses energy.

## Authenticity Cues
* Whiteboard verbs circled (“glow,” “crash,” “breathe”).
* Session chatter: “Let’s comp the doubles before we print the pre‑master.”
* Engineer labeling stems: Lead_Vox_MAIN, Lead_Vox_DBL, BG_HUM_STACK.
