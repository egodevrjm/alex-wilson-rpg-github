## Description
A deeply personal Country/Americana ballad exploring grief and healing through the quiet acceptance of loss. Evoking artists like Brandi Carlile and Kacey Musgraves, the song opens with delicate fingerpicked acoustic guitar, gradually building to include warm piano chords, subtle fiddle harmonies, and understated percussion. Alex Wilson's rich, emotive vocals are more whispered confessions than dramatic pronouncements, creating an intimate atmosphere perfect for late-night reflection. The radio-friendly hook, centered on the image of 'slippers by the door,' is tender and repeatable, emphasizing remembrance and connection over overt sorrow. Grounded in Brynn's true story, the song avoids sentimentality, offering a poignant snapshot of a moment frozen in time and the slow, quiet process of finding peace within it.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Six weeks gone, keys in my hand feel like lead,
Driveway cracks whisper secrets unsaid.
Turn the knob slow, like I'm breakin' a spell,
Step inside quiet, where the echoes still dwell.
Dust on the mantel, clock tickin' alone,
But it's her in the air, callin' me home.

Pre-Chorus
That familiar warmth, like a hug from the past,
Shampoo on the breeze, makin' time move too fast.

Chorus
Slippers by the door, waitin' like she might return,
Hallway holdin' memories that the world forgot to learn.
Frozen in the frame, where the light starts to fade,
But somehow it heals, in the quiet we've made.
Slippers by the door, they're all that's left to say,
She's here in the silence, showin' me the way.

Verse 2
Coat on the hook, coffee cup in the sink,
Little pieces of her, more than you'd think.
I stand there and breathe, let the stillness sink in,
No rush to move on, no place to begin.
The house hasn't changed, it's me that's been gone,
Findin' my way back, one breath at a time.

Pre-Chorus
That lingering scent, like a soft, faded song,
Pullin' me closer, where I know I belong.

Chorus
Slippers by the door, waitin' like she might return,
Hallway holdin' memories that the world forgot to learn.
Frozen in the frame, where the light starts to fade,
But somehow it heals, in the quiet we've made.
Slippers by the door, they're all that's left to say,
She's here in the silence, showin' me the way.

Bridge
No thunder, no storm, just the soft afternoon glow,
Whisperin' peace in the spaces we know.
I pick up her sweater, fold it away slow,
Feelin' the love that the years couldn't steal.
It's not about leavin', it's learnin' to stay,
In the heart of the home, where she'll never fade away.
And maybe someday, the tears will start to mend,
'Til then, I'll keep her love here in the end

Chorus
Slippers by the door, waitin' like she might return,
Hallway holdin' memories that the world forgot to learn.
Frozen in the frame, where the light starts to fade,
But somehow it heals, in the quiet we've made.
Slippers by the door... they're all that's left to say.

Outro
She's here in the silence... showin' me the way.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked), piano (warm, sustained chords), subtle fiddle harmonies (primarily backing vocals and fills), upright bass (or bass guitar with a muted tone), light percussion (brushes on snare, soft kick drum). Tempo: Slow and deliberate, allowing each note to breathe. Mood: Reflective, melancholic, but ultimately hopeful. Vocal Delivery: Understated and intimate, focusing on conveying emotion through subtle nuances rather than vocal power. The pre-chorus builds slightly in intensity, both musically and vocally. The bridge offers a shift in perspective, moving towards acceptance. The final chorus fades gently, leaving the listener with a sense of peace. The song should be mixed with a focus on clarity and warmth, ensuring that each instrument contributes to the overall emotional impact. Fiddle harmonies enter in the second verse/chorus to add depth. The piano arpeggios are simple, repeated, and supportive of the melody. Ending guitar fades slowly with the last lyric.
