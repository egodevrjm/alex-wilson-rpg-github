## Description
A high-energy, radio-ready country-pop anthem. "Champagne Mistakes" explodes with a driving beat and a tale of reckless abandon. Opening with vibrant acoustic guitar over a four-chord progression, punctuated by stomping drums and lively banjo riffs that mirror the vocal melody, the song builds into a soaring chorus propelled by a twangy Telecaster and shimmering pedal steel. Gang vocals and handclaps amplify the playful, honky-tonk atmosphere, capturing the exhilarating feeling of living in the moment, consequences be damned.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Neon crown on her head, high heels on the floor,
Whole bar’s hollerin’ louder than the band on tour.
She leaned in close with that daredevil grin,
Said, “Boy, play me trouble—let’s see where it begins.”
I knew better, but better don’t sing,
So I raised my glass and we let it ring.

Pre-Chorus
One night only, hearts off the leash,
Truth’s in the bottom of a peach schnapps speech.

Chorus
Champagne mistakes, glitter and sin,
Ain’t no forever, but damn it’s a win.
We’ll toast to the chaos, laugh ‘til we break,
Living like legends on champagne mistakes.
Yeah, midnight’s a preacher, and we’re the choir it makes,
Raisin’ our hands for champagne mistakes.

Verse 2
She said, “I’m spoken for,” then ordered a round,
I said, “So am I,” and the room spun down.
We weren’t lookin’ for tomorrow, just the rush of tonight,
Two fireworks crashin’ in borrowed light.
Phones out recordin’, but I didn’t care,
We were history happenin’ out of thin air.

Pre-Chorus
If wisdom’s a virtue, let’s save it for dawn,
This bar’s a confessional we’ll never lean on.

Chorus
Champagne mistakes, glitter and sin,
Ain’t no forever, but damn it’s a win.
We’ll toast to the chaos, laugh ‘til we break,
Living like legends on champagne mistakes.
Yeah, midnight’s a preacher, and we’re the choir it makes,
Raisin’ our hands for champagne mistakes.

Bridge
Maybe regret will crawl in with the sun,
But tonight’s too young for the damage it’s done.
Hearts ain’t saints, they’re outlaws in lace,
And I’d ride again through that same wild place.

Chorus
Champagne mistakes, glitter and sin,
Ain’t no forever, but damn it’s a win.
We’ll toast to the chaos, laugh ‘til we break,
Living like legends on champagne mistakes.
Yeah, midnight’s a preacher, and we’re the choir it makes,
Raisin’ our hands for champagne mistakes.

Outro
So here’s to the stories we’ll never retell,
A beautiful secret that carried us well.
Champagne Mistakes.


## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic Guitar (rhythm), Electric Guitar (Telecaster - lead licks and fills), Banjo (answering vocal lines, adding rhythmic texture), Pedal Steel Guitar (subtle harmonies in the chorus), Drums (driving four-on-the-floor beat with fills), Bass Guitar (grooving bassline), Handclaps (during chorus and outro), Gang Vocals (during chorus). Tempo: 124 BPM. Vibe: Energetic, playful, reckless, and slightly nostalgic. Key: G Major. Structure: Verse 1 - Pre-Chorus - Chorus - Verse 2 - Pre-Chorus - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus - Outro. Production Notes: Layered vocals, prominent drums, and shimmering instrumentation create a modern country-pop sound. Consider adding a subtle synth pad underneath the chorus for added depth. Vocals should be upfront and slightly compressed. Pedal steel should be subtle and not overpowering.
