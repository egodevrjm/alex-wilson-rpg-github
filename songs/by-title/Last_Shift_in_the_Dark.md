## Lyrics

(Intro - Slow acoustic guitar picking with haunting pedal steel, setting a melancholic country ballad vibe, like a farewell under fading mine lights)

(Verse 1)
For a hundred twenty-three years, we've dug deep in the ground,
Granddaddies and fathers, in the black heart of town.
Coal dust in our lungs, calluses on our hands,
Built this community on the sweat of the land.
From the first pickaxe swing to the last loaded cart,
Generations of miners gave body and heart.
But now the bosses say it's time to shut down,
Leavin' empty shafts and a ghost of a town.

(Pre-Chorus)
We lost brothers to cave-ins, fathers to the black lung fight,
Sacrifices forgotten in the cold corporate light.

(Chorus - Emotional, anthemic hook with harmonies and fiddle swells)
Last shift in the dark, sayin' goodbye to the vein,
123 years of blood, sweat, and pain.
Granddaddies gone, their lives lost in the deep,
Now the mine's closin', puttin' the whole town to sleep.
No more whistles blowin', no more lamps in the night,
Community scatterin' like dust in the light.
Last shift in the dark, end of an era's call,
A town's heart breakin', watchin' it all fall.

(Verse 2)
Remember old Joe, crushed 'neath the timber beam,
And young Billy's cough that stole his dream.
Families gathered 'round for the company store,
Now boarded windows, ain't no jobs no more.
Kids playin' in streets that used to bustle with pride,
Now echoes of laughter as the last train rides.
The church bells toll for what we used to be,
A minin' town dyin', set our spirits free.

(Pre-Chorus)
We fought for our livin', held on through the strife,
But progress don't care 'bout a miner's life.

(Chorus - Building intensity, full band sorrow)
Last shift in the dark, sayin' goodbye to the vein,
123 years of blood, sweat, and pain.
Granddaddies gone, their lives lost in the deep,
Now the mine's closin', puttin' the whole town to sleep.
No more whistles blowin', no more lamps in the night,
Community scatterin' like dust in the light.
Last shift in the dark, end of an era's call,
A town's heart breakin', watchin' it all fall.

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic lament, then rises)
We'll carry the stories, the scars on our skin,
From the depths of the earth to where new lives begin.
Though the lights go out and the gates swing shut,
Our bond's unbreakable, in our hearts it's cut.

(Verse 3)
The coal dust settles, a blanket of gray,
On rusted equipment, where dreams used to play.
The memories linger, like echoes in the shaft,
Of laughter and hardship, a hard-fought aftermath.
The younger ones leaving, to find a new way,
While the older ones stay, to face a darker day.
But the spirit remains, though the future's unclear,
The heart of this town, will conquer all fear.

(Chorus - Final, heartfelt fade with echoes)
Last shift in the dark, sayin' goodbye to the vein,
123 years of blood, sweat, and pain.
Granddaddies gone, their lives lost in the deep,
Now the mine's closin', puttin' the whole town to sleep.
No more whistles blowin', no more lamps in the night,
Community scatterin' like dust in the light.
Last shift in the dark, end of an era's call,
A town's heart breakin', watchin' it all fall.

(Outro - Fades with lone guitar and distant mine whistle sound)
Last shift... in the dark...
Goodbye, old friend...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked), Pedal Steel Guitar (prominent, mournful lines), Fiddle (melodic fills and solos), Upright Bass (or muted electric bass), Brush Drums (minimal percussion), Harmonies (male backing vocals in choruses). The song should breathe, allowing space between the phrases. The dynamics build gradually from the quiet verses to the powerful choruses. The pedal steel guitar plays a crucial role in setting the mood and adding emotional depth. The fiddle provides countermelodies and instrumental breaks. The bridge should feature a subtle increase in intensity, culminating in a soaring pedal steel solo. The outro should fade out slowly, leaving a lasting impression of melancholy and loss. Consider adding the sound of a pickaxe hitting rock subtly in the background of the verses, or even the whoosh of a mine elevator descending or ascending. Keyboards can be used for subtle pads to thicken the sound in the choruses.
