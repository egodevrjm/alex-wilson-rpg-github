On Saturday, July 5th, 2025, the Netflix documentary “Finding Rosie” revealed that Judith Wilson of Pikeville, KY was vanished country legend Rosie Walker. Her 22-year-old grandson Alex Wilson, a former coal miner and struggling musician, discovered this truth along with the rest of the world. In his grandmother’s bedroom, he found:  
  
1. **A shoebox** with 93 original songs (1973-2022)  
1. **A leather journal** with 16 songs including the lost album “Burn the Paper Dress”  
1. **Legal documents** including her original RCA contract (voidable - she was a minor) and an exit letter confirming all post-1973 work belongs to her estate  
  
Within 48 hours, Alex:
