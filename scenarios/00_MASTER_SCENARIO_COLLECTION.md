## 1\. Scenario: The Inheritance Gambit \- Rosie Walker's Ghost (Age 20\)

**Setup:** It's early September 2025, eight weeks after Alex's 20th birthday. His grandmother Rose died last week. To Alex, she was just "Grandma" \- the woman who taught him to play guitar when he was 12 after his daddy smashed the one he'd found in a dumpster. She gave him her 1959 Martin D-28 that day. She'd warned him: "Music is dangerous, boy. Play for yourself, keep it quiet, keep it hidden."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Two days after the funeral, a lawyer from Nashville called. Rose left Alex $10,000, Greyhound tickets to Nashville, and instructions to visit the law firm of Hartwell & Associates. Alex has to leave without his dad knowing.

**What Alex doesn't know \- The Legend of Rosie Walker:**

- Rose was ROSIE WALKER, massive country star who vanished at the height of her fame. Her song "Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go to Nashville)" is a country standard.  
- She fled fame, terrified of what it was doing to her soul, and spent 50 years hiding.  
- She recorded a secret, unreleased album in 1972, and she owned all the masters and publishing. It's estimated to be worth millions.

**The inheritance conditions (revealed at law firm):**

1. Visit the vault containing her complete history \- journals, photos, the truth.  
2. Read her letter explaining why she ran and why she regrets making him hide his gift.  
3. Live in a Nashville content house for 3 months (always-on streaming, zero privacy).  
4. Perform three original songs at the Bluebird Cafe within those 3 months.  
5. If he completes all conditions, he inherits everything.

**Rose's final wish (in her letter):**

- Alex must make it on his OWN merit first.  
- He can't reveal he's Rosie Walker's grandson until after the Bluebird performance.  
- "Don't be the coward I was. Face the light I ran from."

**Scene opens:** Tuesday, 5:47 AM, Pikeville Greyhound station. Alex stands with his duffel and the Martin case. The $10,000 sits alien in his account. His flip phone shows three texts from Dad: "Where's the truck?" "Boy, you better answer." "I'm coming to the Piggly Wiggly." The bus is boarding. Nashville is 4 hours away. His dad will be at the Piggly Wiggly in 20 minutes. Time to choose: the familiar hell or the unknown.

## 2\. Scenario: The Texas Redemption \- Breaking the Cycle (Age 14-15)

**Setup:** It's late June 2020\. Alex is 14\. Three weeks ago, a neighbor saw the map of scars on his back and called 911\. The investigation uncovered a decade of horrific abuse by his father, David. Alex ran the moment he heard "placement" and has been living in the Daniel Boone Forest for 12 days.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

A pursuit team, including a veteran social worker and a trauma specialist, is closing in. They know he's a survivor, but they don't know the extent of his resilience or the depth of his fear.

**The Texas connection (unknown to Alex):**

- David Coleman, founder of a specialized ranch for severely traumatized boys in Texas, saw security footage of Alex saving another kid.  
- Coleman's program takes "unfixable" cases and has a 100% success rate, using equine therapy to rebuild trust.  
- They have specifically requested Alex, seeing a spirit in him that refuses to break.

**Hidden detail:** Alex carries a photo of his mother hidden in his boot. He talks to it at night, apologizing for being born.

**Scene opens:** Dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is teaching himself to juggle river stones, humming a melody his grandma taught him. Through the morning mist, he sees Sheriff Bradshaw. "You okay there, Sheriff?" Alex calls out, genuinely concerned. "These woods can be tricky if you don't know them." The Sheriff's hand moves to his radio. Alex's body goes rigid, hypervigilant, already calculating escape routes. The humming stops.

---

## 3\. Scenario: The California Promise \- The Prodigy Papers (Age 11-12)

**Setup:** It's early July 2017\. Alex is 11\. His father, David, died six weeks ago in a drunk driving accident. With no relatives coming forward, Alex has been living in the forest, not just surviving but thriving, building an elaborate shelter and trading fish for books.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The investigation into his father's home revealed a horrifying history of abuse, but also academic tests showing Alex has a genius-level IQ of 147 and perfect pitch.

**The UCLA connection (unknown to Alex):**

- Dr. Sarah Chen-Martinez, a researcher specializing in "Extraordinary Resilience in Severe Childhood Trauma," reviews Alex's case file. He fits every marker of her study.  
- She and her husband, James, have been trying to adopt for five years. James, a musician, sees a video of Alex playing guitar and calls it "generational talent."  
- They live in a home with a music studio built for the child they never had.

**The legal complexity:** The state wants to make him a ward, distant relatives are suddenly interested in potential inheritance money, and the media has caught wind of the "Wild Child of Pike County."

**Scene opens:** Pre-dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is juggling rocks while humming a melody. "Helps me think in patterns," he tells the raccoons. Through the mist, Sheriff Bradshaw approaches. Alex looks up with impossibly blue eyes. "Morning, Sheriff. You're up awful early. Bad dreams? I get those too." His hand instinctively moves toward the hidden knife in his boot, body coiled to run.

---

## 4\. Scenario: The Highway Hymnal \- American Odyssey (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's October 14th, 2027\. Alex is 22\. In the last 24 hours: he was laid off from the mine, his girlfriend dumped him, his truck "Dolly" died, and he got an eviction notice. He found his father's journal, detailing plans to "beat the music out of the boy." He’s hit rock bottom.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**What Alex carries:**

- Grandmother's Martin D-28.  
- Army surplus duffel with a few changes of clothes and a photo of his mother.  
- $247 cash.  
- A flip phone.

He hitched a ride to Lexington with a trucker. His only plan: busk until he has gas money, sleep in parks, play any bar that'll have him, and head south before winter. His one goal: Don't become his father.

**What's already in motion (Alex doesn't know):**

- A TikTok of him playing, posted by his ex, has 847K views.  
- Three Nashville scouts are in Pikeville chasing "Pikeville Phantom" rumors from his secret ham radio broadcasts.  
- \#MurphysBarGuy is still a minor legend from a one-off performance years ago.

**Scene opens:** Downtown Lexington, 2nd and Main, 4:47 PM. October wind cuts through his flannel. Alex stands outside a closed bank, guitar case open. A businesswoman in a $3,000 suit walks directly into a newspaper box while staring at him. "Ma'am, you alright?" he asks, rushing to help. She stammers, drops a $20 in his case, and flees. "But I haven't even played yet," Alex calls after her. He looks at the $20, positions his fingers on the frets. \[What song does Alex play?\]

---

## 5\. Scenario: The Murphy's Bar Revelation \- Lightning in a Bottle (Age 20\)

**Setup:** It's November 8th, 2025, Friday night. Alex is 20, working the night shift at Cochran Mine. For six months, he's brought his grandmother's guitar to Murphy's Bar every Friday, but never plays. It's owner Eddie Murphy's 65th birthday, and he's had enough of the mystery.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**Tonight's crowd:**

- A bachelorette party from Louisville, including bridesmaid Becca Chen (2.3M TikTok followers), who is livestreaming "Real Kentucky."  
- Three Nashville session musicians, driving through on a whim.

**Eddie's birthday ultimatum:** "Wilson\! One song for my birthday or you're barred for a month\!" The whole bar goes quiet.

**What's about to happen:**

- Becca's phone is propped on her Corona, streaming to 50K viewers.  
- The Nashville musicians will recognize something extraordinary.  
- The video will hit 1M views in 4 hours.  
- \#MurphysBarGuy will trend globally by midnight.  
- Three record labels will have scouts driving to Pikeville by dawn.

**Scene opens:** Alex reluctantly takes the tiny corner stage. The Martin's case clicks open—several people gasp at the vintage guitar. "Sorry if I mess it up, Mr. Murphy. I've never done this with people watching." The first note rings out—pure, clear, like a bell in a cavern. The Nashville musicians exchange looks that say "holy shit." Becca's viewer count jumps to 75K. \[What song does Alex play?\]

---

## 6\. Scenario: The Mine Collapse Vigil \- Songs Through Stone (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's March 3rd, 2025, 11:47 AM. Cochran Mine's Tunnel 4 has collapsed with seven men inside, including Alex's mentor Tommy and his shift partner Junior. It's been 16 hours. Rescue teams say it will be days. The families are gathered at the entrance, a vigil of grief and desperate hope.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The national media has descended. The governor is on site. The air is frigid and thick with tension. Mary Harlan, Tommy’s wife, remembers something her husband said: "That Wilson boy sings like an angel." A whisper spreads through the crowd: "Alex could sing something." Not for the cameras, but for the men below.

**What will happen:**

- Alex's voice will carry beautifully in the night air.  
- CNN will cut to him mid-song, no context needed.  
- The men below will swear they heard something, a voice that gave them the strength to last another 66 hours.

**Scene opens:** The mine entrance, harsh under emergency floodlights. Coal dust is caked on Alex's face. Mrs. Harlan's hand finds his arm. "Please, Alex. Tommy talks about you all the time. Says you got a voice that could wake the dead or calm the dying. Just... sing something. So they know we're here." He looks at his truck, Dolly, the Martin visible through the back window. \[What song does Alex play?\]

---

## 7\. Scenario: The Wedding Crasher's Revenge \- The Song She Needed (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's June 21st, 2025\. Amy Stevens, Alex's first love, is marrying Chase Matthews, a rich dealer's son who has her hooked on pills and under his thumb. Alex gets a frantic series of texts from Amy's younger sister, Emma: "PLEASE. She's been crying all day. Says she made a mistake. Still loves you. Service door by kitchen unlocked for 2 mins."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The stakes:**

- Chase and his groomsmen are armed, high, and dangerous.  
- The wedding photographer is secretly shooting for VICE.  
- Security has Alex's photo with instructions: "Do not admit."  
- Alex has the song he wrote after she left, a song he's never played for anyone.

**Scene opens:** Pikeville Country Club parking lot, 8:43 PM. Alex sits in Dolly, watching Amy in her white dress through the ballroom windows, looking like a ghost at her own funeral. His phone buzzes: "NOW. Kitchen door." He sees Emma frantically waving from a service entrance. Two minutes to change everything or lose everything. He opens the truck door. \[What song does Alex play?\]

---

## 8\. Scenario: The Livestream Accident \- Digital Destiny (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's September 15th, 2023\. Alex is 18, working at an auto repair shop. His coworker, Brad, runs a small Twitch stream ("RealKentuckyLife") and begged Alex to cover for him while he's sick. Alex, who thinks "going viral" means getting sick from the internet, agrees.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

At noon, following his routine, Alex takes the phone (still streaming) out to his truck, Dolly, for his lunch break. He props "Gerald the phone" against his toolbox, pulls out his guitar, and for 20 minutes, he plays a song about his father he's never played for anyone.

**What happens in those 20 minutes:**

- 12:00 \- Viewer count: 47

- 12:20 \- Reporters are calling the auto shop.

**Scene opens:** Henderson's Auto Repair, 12:00 PM. Alex, oblivious to the chat losing its mind over him, climbs into the truck bed. "Okay, Miss Margaret," he says to the guitar, "let's see how you're feeling today." He opens the case. The viewer count is 127 and rising fast. \[What song does Alex play?\]

---

## 9\. Scenario: The Talent Show Trap \- No Way Out (Age 17\)

**Setup:** It's April 18th, 2023\. Alex is 17\. The high school's mandatory "Spring Showcase" is tonight. Perform, or you don't graduate. Alex has avoided this for years, but the principal closed every loophole. His father plans to attend "to watch you humiliate yourself."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Alex's plan to do a boring monologue is ruined when he loses his voice from mine dust and panic. He's hiding in the janitor's closet, guitar in its case for moral support. His ex, Amy, is performing. His father is in the auditorium, already drunk.

**The trigger:** Another student, Tyler, finds him in the bathroom, sees the guitar case, and runs out screaming, "WILSON'S GONNA PLAY GUITAR\!" The rumor spreads like fire backstage. Now, everyone expects it.

**Scene opens:** Backstage bathroom, 6:47 PM. Alex is splashing water on his face, voice completely gone. The door swings shut. He looks at the guitar case, then at his reflection. His mother's eyes stare back. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 10\. Scenario: The Overdose Save \- Grace in the Alley (Age 21\)

**Setup:** It's February 9th, 2027, 2:17 AM in Lexington. Alex, 21, is walking home from a warehouse shift. In an alley, he finds a 19-year-old girl, blue-lipped and barely breathing from an opioid overdose. 911 will be too long. He needs to keep her awake.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Remembering his grandmother's words—"Music can pull people back from the edge"—he makes a desperate choice. He pulls out his guitar and begins to play and sing directly to her, inches from her face, a raw, intimate performance to anchor her to life.

**Who she is:** Rebecca "Becca" Hartwell, daughter of Kentucky's lieutenant governor.

**The aftermath:** EMTs arrive and save her. Alex vanishes after giving a fake name. The hospital's grainy security footage goes viral: "Lexington's Guardian Angel." Becca's powerful father is using every resource to find the "angel boy" who saved his daughter.

**Scene opens:** Two weeks later. Alex's motel room, 6 AM. Pounding on the door. A black SUV with government plates is outside. "Mr. Wilson? We know you're in there. Miss Hartwell would like to thank you." The doorknob starts to turn. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 11\. Scenario: The Ham Radio Midnight \- Phantom Waves (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's December 24th, 2024, 11:47 PM. Alex is 19, alone in his trailer on Christmas Eve. For months, he's been anonymously broadcasting on his grandfather's old ham radio, playing guitar and talking to the static as "Nobody from Nowhere."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

He doesn't know the ham radio community calls him "The Pikeville Phantom," that his broadcasts are recorded and shared online, or that record labels are trying to find him. Tonight, drunk and lonely, he decides to tell his whole story, thinking no one is listening.

**Who's actually listening:**

- Margaret Chen, a music journalist who has been tracking him for months.  
- His ex, Amy, scanning frequencies in Cincinnati.  
- 847 other people, all recording.

**The morning after:** He wakes up with no memory of the broadcast, 147 missed calls, and a text from Amy: "I'm outside." His yard is full of cars: Amy's Honda, three news vans, and a black SUV with Tennessee plates. His phone rings. It's the jail. His father's voice, sober for once: "Boy... I heard your broadcast. We need to talk."

**Scene opens:** December 25th, 6:47 AM. Alex wakes up on the floor. He finds the entire broadcast on YouTube, titled "PIKEVILLE PHANTOM REVEALS EVERYTHING." 2.3M views. A car door slams outside. Then another. And another. The knock comes. "Alex? It's Amy." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 12\. Scenario: The Bad Deal \- Music Row Trap (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's October 3rd, 2024\. Alex is 19 and has been in Nashville for four months, signed to a predatory 360-deal after being discovered at Murphy's Bar. He lives in a label-owned writers' house, already $127K in debt to them, and has yet to deliver a single song, paralyzed by the pressure.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Tomorrow is a mandatory label showcase for CEOs and investors. He has to perform three songs. His A\&R handler, Sarah, who staked her career on him, has given him an ultimatum: perform or be sued into oblivion.

**The hidden dynamics:**

- Another writer in the house has been secretly recording Alex's 3 AM phone demos.  
- His ex, Amy, has leaked old videos of him, which are going viral.  
- A Rolling Stone article, "The Invisible Boy Wonder of Music Row," is about to drop.

**Scene opens:** The House, 11:47 PM. Alex sits on his bedroom floor, surrounded by crumpled excuses. A knock. It's a housemate. "Alex? Sarah's downstairs. She says if you don't come down, they're sending legal up. She brought someone with her. Some woman named Rose? Says she knew your grandmother?" Alex's blood freezes. Nobody should know that name. The doorknob turns. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 13\. Scenario: The Church Testimony \- Prodigal at the Pulpit (Age 20\)

**Setup:** It's August 18th, 2025\. Rose Wilson's memorial service at Pikeville First Baptist. The church is packed with 400 people who watched Alex get beaten as a child and did nothing. Now, they want him to "share a few words."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

An hour ago, the pastor revealed what he'd discovered: Rose was secretly Rosie Walker, the country music legend. She was also the anonymous donor who funded the church for 40 years with $1.8 million. He hands Alex a vinyl record he found among her things: Rosie Walker's unreleased album, with a note that says it belongs to Alex.

**The congregation's guilt:** They want Alex's forgiveness without asking for it. His abusive father, David, is in the third pew, six months sober, crying.

**Scene opens:** First Baptist Church. 400 faces are turned toward Alex. The pulpit looks like a gallows. His father mouths "please, son." The vinyl in his pocket feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. The pastor clears his throat: "Alex? We're all here to remember Rose..." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 14\. Scenario: The Prison Visit \- Deathbed Confession (Age 23\)

**Setup:** It's November 29th, 2028\. Alex is 23\. The prison chaplain called: his father, David, is dying of liver failure and asking for him. Alex drove 1,100 miles straight through.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**David's cryptic message:** "Tell him Abigail didn't die from childbirth. Tell him about the other baby. Tell him to bring his guitar."

**The deal with the devil:** The warden offers a deal. Perform for the inmates at the prison talent show, and get three hours of private visitation. Refuse, and get 30 minutes through glass. The inmates include men David testified against.

**What David's box contains (unknown to Alex):** Hospital bracelets for "Baby Boy A" and "Baby Boy B," a death certificate for "Samuel Wilson \- 3 hours old," a newspaper clipping about a trailer fire, and his mother's diary entry: "Twins. David doesn't want two."

**Scene opens:** Prison visiting room. Alex can see the inmates gathering for the show. Through another window, he sees David in a wheelchair, holding a box. The intercom crackles: "Talent show starts in ten minutes. You're third." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 15\. Scenario: The Protest Stage \- Coal Dust Uprising (Age 21\)

**Setup:** It's June 3rd, 2027\. Alex is 21, back in Pikeville for the first time in two years. He finds his hometown at war. Cochran Mining is evicting 200 families, including his own, to expand a mountaintop removal site. The town has set up a protest camp at the mine entrance, and morale is failing.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

The sheriff has given them until dawn to disperse before mass arrests begin. The crowd sees Alex, their hometown boy who "made it" on YouTube. A chant begins: "Alex\! Alex\! Sing our story\!"

**The stakes:**

- If he takes the stage, he becomes the face of the resistance, a target for a powerful corporation, and risks federal charges.  
- If he refuses, he betrays his hometown and lives with the knowledge that he could have helped.

**Scene opens:** Mine entrance, 5:47 AM. Dawn is breaking. 500 people look to Alex. The protest stage is empty, a microphone waiting like a loaded gun. The crowd parts, creating a path to the stage. The sheriff's deadline is in 17 minutes. His mother is buried 200 yards away, in land they plan to strip mine. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 16\. Scenario: The Stadium Soundcheck (Age 19\)

**Setup:** It's May 17th, 2024\. Rupp Arena, Lexington. Alex is 19, working as a last-minute roadie for Zach Bryan's sold-out show. The opening act's flight was cancelled. The tour manager is panicking: "Find me someone local or we're fucked." The venue is empty except for the crew.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**What Alex doesn't know:**

- The sound engineer is recording the soundcheck.  
- Zach Bryan is on his tour bus, listening to the venue feed.  
- Three music bloggers have snuck into the upper deck.  
- The monitor engineer noticed Alex humming perfect harmonies earlier.

**Scene opens:** The tour manager storms onto the stage. "Where's my fucking opener?" The house lights are on full, the 23,000 empty seats stretching into darkness. The sound engineer jokes into the mic, "Hell, let the pretty roadie play. Bet he knows three chords." The tour manager, desperate, says, "I'll pay $1000 cash to anyone who can fill 30 minutes and doesn't suck." The monitor engineer looks directly at Alex: "Kid was humming 'Something in the Orange' in perfect harmony. Just saying." Everyone turns to stare. Through the loading dock, Alex can see his truck, Dolly, and the guitar case within. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 17\. Scenario: The Flood Rescue (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's April 23rd, 2023, 11:30 PM. Pikeville is drowning. The levee failed. Alex, 18, is in his johnboat, pulling survivors from the churning water. He has a hypothermic woman in the boat, three rescued dogs tied alongside, a dying flashlight, and a half-tank of gas. His guitar is wrapped in a trash bag at his feet.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

- **Nursing Home:** 12 residents are on the second floor, singing "Amazing Grace." The current is pulling him in this direction.

**Scene opens:** The johnboat scrapes a submerged stop sign. Mrs. Chen, shivering violently, grabs his arm. "Save the child," she gasps. "Let me steer." From Murphy's, a shout: "WILSON\! WE'RE SLIPPING\!" Another scream from the school. The church bell rings frantically. The current makes the choice for him, pulling hard toward the nursing home. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 18\. Scenario: The Border Crossing (Age 21\)

**Setup:** It's March 3rd, 2027, 2:15 AM. Cancún International Airport. Alex, 21, has been playing beach bars under a fake name. He just got word his father is dying in Pikeville. His tourist visa is expired. To board the last flight home, he needs to pay a $500 fine he doesn't have.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

## 19\. Scenario: The Revival Tent (Age 15\)

**Setup:** It's August 18th, 2020\. A traveling revival tent is in the Walmart parking lot. Alex, 15, is forced to attend by his newly sober father. The preacher, "Pastor" Roy, brings out four live rattlesnakes.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The pressure builds:**

- Pastor Roy's daughter, Sarah, is playing guitar on stage. She recognizes Alex and wants his help to escape her father.  
- Alex's father volunteers him to testify. "My boy's got something to say about forgiveness."  
- Pastor Roy's tradition is to make the "youngest sinner" prove their faith by handling a snake. Sarah whispers to Alex, "The copper-colored one still has fangs."

**Hidden agendas:** State police are outside, waiting to arrest Roy. Amy Stevens is in the crowd with her youth group, recording everything.

**Scene opens:** The tent reeks of sweat and sawdust. Pastor Roy's voice booms, "WHO WILL TESTIFY?" Alex's father stands, pushing him forward. "Come on up, son. Bring your pain to Jesus." The crowd parts. The copper-colored snake raises its head. Sarah holds up her guitar. "Maybe he could sing his testimony?" A state trooper peers through the tent flap. \[What does Alex do?\]

- The anonymous benefactor who paid $50,000 for the session is dying; this is their last wish.  
- His ex, Amy, now a music executive, is the one who set this up.  
- A mystery observer behind the control room glass has a $10 million contract waiting.  
- The entire session is being filmed for a documentary.

**Scene opens:** Studio B's live room glows. Rubin, in his beard and sunglasses, says, "We roll at midnight. Pick your first song." A text from an unknown number: "Your mother's name was really Sarah. Thought you should know before you sing." The bass player looks at him. "Holy shit, you're Rosie Walker's grandson." Everyone stops. Looks. Waits. \[What song does Alex choose first?\]

## 21\. Scenario: The Courthouse Steps (Age 15\)

**Setup:** It's July 19th, 2020\. Alex, just turned 15, has been subpoenaed to testify at his father's trial for assault. Alex is the only sober witness. His testimony will decide if his father gets 2 years or 20\.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**What really happened:** The victim, Tom, mentioned that Alex's mother, Abigail, was planning to leave David the night she died. David snapped.

**The bombshell:** A CPS worker, Sarah, has been digging. She found Abigail's family—the wealthy and powerful Boones of Monterey, California. They believed both Abigail and her baby died 15 years ago. They chartered a private jet and are landing in Lexington in 20 minutes.

**Scene opens:** The courthouse steps. The bailiff calls, "Calling Alexander Wilson to the stand." His father's lawyer whispers, "You didn't see nothing." The prosecutor says, "Just tell the truth." Amy pushes through the crowd to support him. His phone buzzes—it's his grandmother from the hospital: "Tell the truth, baby." The CPS worker rushes up, out of breath. "Alex, wait\! Your mother's family... they're alive. They're coming." A black SUV convoy turns onto Main Street. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 22\. Scenario: The Judith Papers (Inheritance Sandbox \- Age 20\)

**This scenario is an alternate inheritance path, focusing on a different secret for Rosie Walker.**

**Setup:** Alex, 20, is in Nashville, working construction and living in a songwriter house. A lawyer calls about his late grandmother Judith's estate. The reveal: Judith was secretly "K.C. Rivers," a ghost-songwriter who wrote five \#1 hits for stars like George Jones and Loretta Lynn in the 70s, taking cash buyouts for no credit.

**The Inheritance:** $2.3 million (the invested buyout money), 47 unreleased songs, and the reverted rights to all five hits, worth millions more.

**The Conditions:** To inherit, Alex must perform three of his own original songs publicly, at least 10 times each, over the next three months. He must use his real name and cannot reveal the inheritance until the conditions are met. If he fails, everything goes to the Country Music Hall of Fame.

**Scene opens:** Outside the Bluebird Cafe. It's the open mic lottery night. Alex is clutching his grandmother's priceless Martin guitar when his housemates, all aspiring songwriters themselves, show up. "Alex\! What are you doing here?" one asks. "Finally gonna play for us?" another jokes. The woman with the sign-up clipboard reaches him. "You playing or watching? The list fills up fast." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 29\. Scenario: The Content House Audition (Age 18\)

**Setup:** Thursday, March 16, 2023\. Alex, 18, stands outside 24East, a converted Victorian in East Nashville. A Craigslist ad for a "musicians' content collective" offered rent for $400/month. Seven other creators live here, filming everything.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Tour Guide:** Rizz (they/them, 22), a chaotic tech genius, explains the house dynamic: "It's giving found family meets reality TV but make it wholesome."

**House Dynamics:** Kitchen territory wars, a single working bathroom, constant noise, and the dreaded "vibe check" dinner tonight.

**Audition Tasks:**

1. Pitch a 30-second intro video concept.  
2. Prove you can handle being filmed constantly.  
3. Show you won't be dead weight on rent.  
4. Survive the house dinner without triggering drama.

**Hidden Agendas:** Lola needs a guitarist for her cover songs. Audra is secretly scouting for her management company. The last musician they had went viral and then ditched them, leaving everyone wary.

**Scene opens:** Rizz points three phones at Alex. "Okay, so, first things first. We need to know you can hang. The vibe check dinner is at 7\. If Maddie doesn't try to poison you over her kale, you're probably in. First, pitch me your thirty-second intro. Make it good. You're live." A red light blinks on the phone closest to his face. \[What is Alex's pitch?\]

## 30\. Scenario: First Cut at Blackbird Studio (Age 18\)

**Setup:** Monday, April 3, 2023, 11:00 PM. The legendary Blackbird Studio. Alex's buddy Marcus, an intern engineer, snuck him in for an "after-hours test session." He has two hours to lay down one track before the morning engineer arrives.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Session:**

- Marcus is high.  
- The talk-back button is broken.  
- There's a mysterious hum in channel 3\.  
- Alex has a maximum of three takes before time runs out.

**The Complication:** At 12:45 AM, the door opens. It's Chelsea Park, a top A\&R executive for Warner Nashville, grabbing some forgotten notes. She stops, listening to the playback of Alex's take.

**Critical Choices:**

- Play it cool vs. pitch hard.  
- Let Marcus take credit vs. own the rule-breaking.  
- Accept her card vs. play hard to get.

**Scene opens:** The Neve console glows like a spaceship. Marcus is giggling at the EQ knobs. Alex has just nailed the vocal on his second take. The sound of it hangs in the air, raw and perfect. The control room door clicks open. A woman in a tailored blazer stands there, holding a phone, her expression unreadable. "Who the hell are you?" she asks, her voice quiet but carrying immense weight. "And what are you doing in my studio?" \[What does Alex say?\]

## 31\. Scenario: Songwriters' Night at Douglas Corner Cafe (Age 18\)

**Setup:** Tuesday, April 18, 2023, 7:30 PM. Douglas Corner Cafe's legendary songwriters' round. Alex talked his way onto the list. He's on a worn wooden stage with three other songwriters, rotating one song each.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Other Songwriters:**

- **Jim Garrett (62):** Wrote hits in the 90s, now bitter about streaming.  
- **Sophia Chen (28):** TikTok famous, despised by traditional Nashville.  
- **Marcus King (35):** Technically brilliant, emotionally hollow. A "guitar nerd's guitarist."

**The Audience:** A mix of tourists, industry veterans, and aspiring writers. In the back corner, unnoticed, sits Rick Rubin, the legendary producer, who came to see an old friend and is now watching Alex.

**The Challenge:** Alex has one song to make an impression. It's his turn. The room is quiet, waiting.

**Scene opens:** The flickering stage light catches the dust motes in the air. Jim Garrett just finished a cynical song about Spotify, earning polite applause. The host nods to Alex. "Alright, son. Your turn. Show us what you got." Alex adjusts the microphone. He can feel the weight of every legend who has played on this stage. He looks out into the crowd, sees the mix of boredom, hope, and judgment. In the back, a man with a huge white beard leans forward slightly, listening. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 32\. Scenario: Coal Dust to Music City (Age 20\)

**Setup:** Wednesday, March 12, 2025, 11:47 PM. Alex, 20, has just arrived in Nashville. He was laid off from the mine, his girlfriend left him, and he decided to take his grandmother's guitars and the $3,200 in severance pay and chase the dream.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**Starting Stats:**

- **Cash:** $437 | **Bank:** $2,800  
- **Guitars:** 1959 Martin D-28
- **Vehicle:** 2001 Ford Ranger (146k miles)  
- **Socials:** None (flip phone only)

**The Crisis:** His truck coughs and dies at a red light on Broadway, the busiest, most iconic street in Music City. Horns blare. A Metro Police officer, Melissa Chen, is walking toward him. A homeless vet, Memphis, catches his eye and points to the two valuable guitar cases visible in the truck bed.

**Scene opens:** The neon of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge bleeds across your rain-streaked windshield. Music pours from every doorway. This is it. But your truck is dead, blocking traffic. "MOVE IT, KENTUCKY\!" someone shouts. Officer Chen is ten feet away, hand on her ticket book. The homeless vet shakes his head, a silent warning about the guitars. Brittany's words sting: "Three thousand dollars? That's what four years of your life is worth?" Now what? \[What do you do?\]

## 33\. Scenario: The Blackberry Creek Legacy (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's 2025\. Alex is 22, three years into working the mine after his MawMaw Judith's death. He feels trapped. A week ago, on the anniversary of her passing, he found a hidden lockbox. Inside: a letter and a journal. The letter revealed his MawMaw was Rosie Walker, the vanished country legend, and that his biological grandfather is George Jones. The journal contains 12 of her complete, unreleased songs.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Her final wish: sell the trailer, take the money, and go to Nashville with his best friend, Tommy Crawford, to tell his own story.

**The Immediate Problem:** The trailer has just been sold for $20,000 cash. A fortune. Alex and Tommy are standing in the gravel driveway. Alex's entire life is packed into his duffel bag and Tommy's truck. The weight of the past and the terrifying, exhilarating future crash down at once.

**Scene opens:** The new owner's car pulls away, leaving a cloud of dust. Tommy slaps Alex on the back. "Twenty grand, man. Twenty. Grand." He holds up the wad of cash. "So. We doing this? We really going to Nashville?" The sun is setting over the ridge, casting long shadows from the coal tipple in the distance. This is the first decision of his new life. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 34\. Scenario: The Rosie Walker Mystery (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's early February 2025\. A Netflix documentary crew is in Pikeville, chasing the first lead in 50 years on the whereabouts of vanished country star Rosie Walker—a journal fragment mentioning the town. They are searching for a ghost.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Meanwhile, Alex Wilson, 22, works the mine, lives in his late grandmother's trailer, and plays her 1959 Martin D-28 at Murphy's Bar on Thursdays for beer money. He has no idea his grandmother was Rosie, or that the guitar is her famous instrument.

**The Accident (Week 2):** On a Thursday night, the crew decides to film "local color" at Murphy's Bar. Alex walks in. The cinematographer freezes. "That guitar… I’ve seen that wear pattern before." They film his set, mesmerized. Back in LA, the remote research team analyzes the footage frame-by-frame. They confirm the serial number. It's Rosie's Martin.

**The Approach (Week 3):** The crew approaches Alex for a paid interview about "Appalachian music traditions." During the interview, he mentions his grandmother, Judith Wilson, raised him. The remote team finds her marriage certificate from March 1973\. Facial recognition software confirms it: Judith Wilson was Rosie Walker. They now know they have found Rosie's grandson, playing her guitar, and he has no idea.

**Scene opens:** A week later. The director, a woman named Chloe, sits across from Alex in his trailer, cameras rolling. "Alex, thanks again for doing this. We just have a few more questions. You mentioned your grandmother never sang. Did she ever talk about Nashville?" Tommy Crawford, sitting on the arm of the couch, snorts. "MawMaw? Hated the place. Used to change the channel if an old country song came on." Chloe leans forward, her expression carefully neutral. "Which songs, specifically?" \[What does Alex say?\]

---

## 35\. Scenario: The Hollywood Honeytrap (Age 22\)

**Setup:** Six months after a video of him playing at Murphy's went viral, Alex is playing a regular Tuesday night gig at The 5 Spot in East Nashville. The place is packed. After his set, a woman approaches him. It's Isabella Vance, one of the biggest movie stars in the world, in town filming a biopic. She tells him she's a huge fan and that his voice is the only real thing she's heard in years.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Honeymoon Phase:** For two weeks, it's a whirlwind. Private jets to LA, parties in the Hollywood Hills, writing songs by her infinity pool. Isabella is smart, funny, and seems genuinely captivated by him. She wants him to write a song for her movie. It feels like a dream.

**The Catch:** Her ex-boyfriend is a notoriously jealous and violent hip-hop mogul who still considers her "his property." Her management team sees Alex as a PR liability and is actively trying to break them up. Paparazzi follow their every move. A tabloid has already run a story titled "Isabella's Backwoods Boy Toy."

**Scene opens:** Alex is in Isabella's suite at the Four Seasons. His guitar is leaning against a wall of windows overlooking the city. Her phone rings. It's her ex. She puts it on speaker. "You still with that fucking hillbilly, Bella? I'm coming to Nashville. We need to talk." The line goes dead. Isabella looks at Alex, her eyes wide with a fear he's seen before—in his own home, years ago. "He's not joking," she whispers. "You need to leave. Now." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 36\. Scenario: The Pikeville Subpoena (Age 22\)

**Setup:** Alex is starting to get real traction in Nashville. He's landed an opening slot for a major artist's tour and is in final negotiations for a publishing deal. He's sitting in his lawyer's office on Music Row, about to sign the papers that will change his life, when the receptionist buzzes. "Mr. Wilson? There's a process server here for you."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Lawsuit:** He's being sued for $2 million for assault and battery. The plaintiff is Chase Matthews, the man whose wedding Alex crashed three years ago to save Amy. Chase claims Alex caused "permanent emotional distress and physical injury" (a broken nose). The lawsuit has been filed by a notoriously aggressive Nashville lawyer known for targeting rising stars.

**The Complication:** The story immediately leaks to the press. The tour's promoter is getting cold feet. The publishing deal is on hold pending the outcome. The lawsuit demands depositions from Amy, her sister Emma, and everyone who was at the wedding—dragging his entire past into his brand-new future. Chase's lawyer offers to settle for $250,000 and a public apology.

**Scene opens:** Alex stands on the pristine marble floor of his lawyer's office, holding the subpoena. The publishing contract sits on the mahogany desk, unsigned. His lawyer, a woman named Carol, sighs. "Well. Welcome to Nashville. The moment you have something to lose, they come for it. Your tour promoter is on line one. The label is on line two. What do you want me to tell them?" \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 37\. Scenario: The Devil's Gig (Age 21\)

**Setup:** Alex is 21 and broke. He's living in a tiny apartment in Donelson, driving for Uber Eats to make rent, and playing any open mic that will have him. An offer comes through a booking agent: a private gig for $50,000, cash. All he has to do is play a one-hour acoustic set.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Client:** The gig is at the lavish estate of Marcus Thorne, a controversial pharmaceutical billionaire whose company is at the center of a massive opioid lawsuit. The party is a fundraiser for a politician known for union-busting and anti-environmental policies—everything that destroyed Alex's hometown.

**The Moral Choice:**

- **Take the gig:** The $50,000 would solve all his problems. It could fund his first EP, buy a reliable van, and let him focus on music full-time for a year.  
- **Refuse the gig:** He'd be turning down life-changing money to stand by his principles. He'd stay broke, but his conscience would be clear.

**The Twist:** A journalist from an independent news outlet has gotten a tip about the party and contacts Alex. "I hear you're playing Thorne's party," she says. "If you wear a wire and record what's said there, we can expose these people. We can't pay you, but you'd be doing the right thing."

**Scene opens:** It's the night of the gig. Alex is sitting in Dolly outside the gates of Thorne's estate. The $25,000 cash advance is in a duffel bag on the passenger seat. His guitar is in the back. His phone buzzes. It's the journalist. "Last chance, Alex. Are you in? Or are you just another musician for hire?" The security guard at the gate taps on his window. "You Wilson? You're on in 30." \[What does Alex do?\]

Of course. Here are 13 new scenarios, bringing the total to 50\. They are formatted to be consistent with the previous collection and integrated with the established lore.

## 38\. Scenario: The Soundalike (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's been a year since Alex arrived in Nashville. He's building a solid reputation for his raw, honest songwriting and his unique vocal style. A new artist, Landon Kade, just dropped his debut single, and it's rocketing up the charts. The problem: the melody is almost identical to a song Alex has been playing at open mics for months, and Kade's vocal delivery mimics Alex's signature gravelly ache.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Complication:** Landon Kade is signed to the biggest label in town and is being pushed as Nashville's next big thing. He's on every radio station, his face on billboards. People are starting to whisper that Alex is the one who's copying *him*. Tommy is furious, urging Alex to fight back.

**The Dilemma:**

- **Go Public:** Accuse Landon Kade of theft. This means taking on a massive corporate machine that could easily bury him in legal fees and blackball him from the industry.  
- **Stay Silent:** Let it go and focus on his own music, knowing that a song he wrote is making someone else a star. This feels like letting his father win—letting someone else take what's his.  
- **The Pikeville Solution:** Confront Landon Kade directly, probably at a bar or backstage, far from any lawyers.

**Scene opens:** The Bluebird Cafe. Alex just finished his set, which included the original version of his song. As he steps off stage, a tourist pats him on the back. "Hey man, you're pretty good\! You do a great cover of that Landon Kade song." In the back of the room, Landon Kade himself is holding court with a group of industry types, laughing. He catches Alex's eye and raises his glass in a mock toast. Tommy puts a hand on Alex's shoulder. "Don't," he says, but his voice is tight with anger. "Don't do it here." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 39\. Scenario: The Mentor's Ghost (Age 23\)

**Setup:** Alex has caught the attention of Harlan "Hank" Crawford, a legendary, reclusive songwriter in his late 70s who wrote hits for Waylon and Cash before disappearing from public life. For three months, Alex has been making weekly pilgrimages to Hank's dilapidated house deep in the Tennessee hills, playing him new songs and listening to his stories. It's the closest thing to a grandfather he's ever had.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Last Request:** Hank is dying of lung cancer. One afternoon, he pushes a dusty reel-to-reel tape recorder towards Alex. "There's one song on there," he rasps. "The last one I ever wrote. 'bout the woman I couldn't save. Never could get the damn thing right." He makes Alex promise to listen to it only after he's gone, and to "finish it right." Hank dies two days later.

**The Secret on the Tape:** Alex plays the tape. It's a haunting, broken, brilliant song about regret. But after the song ends, there's a voice-memo recording. It's Hank, talking to a friend years ago. He's drunk, and he's confessing: he was there the night Rosie Walker played her last show. He helped her get on the bus out of town because she was running from a powerful, abusive label executive—the same executive who now runs the label that is currently scouting Alex.

**Scene opens:** Alex sits in his apartment, the silence after the tape's confession deafening. The song Hank left him is a masterpiece, but it's tied to a secret that could protect him or destroy his chances in Nashville. His phone rings. It's the label executive, the one from the tape. "Alex," the voice says smoothly, "I heard about Harlan. A great talent. Listen, I want to bring you in tomorrow. I think it's time we made you a star." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 40\. Scenario: The High School Reunion (Age 24\)

**Setup:** Alex is 24 and has a certified Gold record. He's a known name, a rising star. He gets an invitation to his five-year high school reunion in Pikeville. Tommy convinces him it'll be a legendary weekend. Amy will be there, now divorced from Chase Matthews. The whole town will be there.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Homecoming:** The moment he and Tommy arrive in Pikeville, it's clear things are different. He's not just "the Wilson boy" anymore; he's a celebrity. Old teachers want autographs. People who ignored him in school now claim to be his best friends. The Sheriff wants a selfie. It's suffocating.

**The Confrontation:** The reunion is held at the Pikeville Country Club—the same place he crashed Amy's wedding. Chase Matthews is there, drunk and belligerent, telling anyone who will listen that Alex stole his life. He's looking for a fight. Meanwhile, Amy is trying to talk to Alex, to apologize, to maybe rekindle something.

**The Choice:** This isn't just a party; it's a referendum on his past. He can be the gracious celebrity, the angry kid who never forgot a slight, or the man who is finally free of this town. Every interaction is being filmed on a dozen phones.

**Scene opens:** The country club ballroom is a sea of familiar, changed faces. The DJ, as a joke, plays the radio single of Alex's hit song. The crowd cheers. Amy is walking toward him, a hopeful, nervous smile on her face. From across the room, Chase Matthews shouts, "Hey superstar\! Still writing songs about other men's wives?" The room goes quiet. A hundred phone cameras are suddenly pointed at him. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 41\. Scenario: The Nashville Blackout (Age 22\)

**Setup:** A massive summer storm has knocked out power to all of East Nashville. It's 9 PM. Alex was supposed to play a showcase at The Basement, but the gig is cancelled. The streets are dark, the bars are closed. People are wandering outside, restless.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Idea:** Tommy, ever the agent of chaos, has an idea. He backs Dolly the F-150 onto the sidewalk in the middle of Five Points, the neighborhood's central hub. He points two high-powered flashlights from the truck bed at Alex. "No power, no problem," he says. "Give 'em a show."

**The Gathering:** At first, it's just a few dozen people. But as the sound of Alex's unamplified voice and acoustic guitar cuts through the silent, dark night, a crowd gathers. People emerge from their powerless homes, drawn by the music. Soon, hundreds of people are standing in the street, phone flashlights held up like lighters, listening in rapt silence.

**The Viral Moment 2.0:** A journalist for the *Nashville Scene* lives in an apartment overlooking the intersection. She starts a livestream. \#NashvilleBlackoutSessons starts trending. This performance is stripped bare—no mics, no lights, no stage. Just his voice, his guitar, and the sound of the rain.

**Scene opens:** Alex is sitting on the tailgate of his truck. A crowd of 200 strangers stands before him in the dark, their faces illuminated by their phones. The only other light comes from the flashlights Tommy has taped to the truck's roll bar. It's an intimate, intense, completely unexpected concert. "I, uh, only know about four more songs," Alex says with a laugh, his voice carrying in the stillness. A woman in the front row shouts, "Then play 'em slow\!" The crowd cheers. \[What song does he play next?\]

---

## 42\. Scenario: The Betrayal (Age 23\)

**Setup:** Alex's career is taking off, but he's fiercely protective of his privacy and his past. He's turned down every interview request from tabloids and gossip sites. One morning, he wakes up to a front-page article on a major music blog titled: "The Secret Pain of Alex Wilson: The Father, The Abuse, The Woman He Saved."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Article:** The piece contains details Alex has only ever told one person: his best friend, Tommy. It details the beatings from his father, the story of crashing Amy's wedding, and quotes lyrics from a song he's never performed, only written in a notebook he keeps in his apartment. The source is quoted as "a close childhood friend."

**The Confrontation:** Alex finds Tommy in their apartment, packing a bag. Tommy can't meet his eye. "They offered me fifty grand, Alex," he says, his voice breaking. "My mom's medical bills... I was gonna tell you. I swear." He had been secretly recording their conversations for weeks.

**The Fallout:** The story is everywhere. The narrative Alex has carefully controlled is shattered. His privacy is gone. And his trust in the one person he thought he had is destroyed.

**Scene opens:** Tommy stands in the doorway, duffel bag in hand. "I'm sorry," he whispers. "I never thought... I just... I can pay it back." Alex's phone is buzzing nonstop with calls from his publicist, his manager, his lawyer. The rawest parts of his life are now public knowledge, sold for cash by his brother. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 43\. Scenario: The Grand Ole Opry Debut (Age 24\)

**Setup:** Alex has been invited to make his debut at the Grand Ole Opry. It is the single biggest moment of his career, the culmination of everything he's worked for. He has an eight-minute slot and is scheduled to play two songs.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Ghost in the Circle:** The Opry is where his grandmother, Rosie Walker, gave her final, legendary performance before she vanished. The old-timers on staff remember her. The archivist shows him a photo of Rosie standing in the very same spot backstage where he's tuning his guitar. "She was a firecracker, that one," the old man says. "Broke every heart and every rule in this building."

**The Dilemma:** Alex planned to play his two biggest hits. But standing in that sacred circle, he's overwhelmed by the weight of his grandmother's legacy. He has one of her unreleased songs memorized—a beautiful, heartbreaking ballad called "Coal Dust Memories." Playing it would be a secret tribute, a nod to the ghost in the room that only he understands. But it's a slow, sad song, not the crowd-pleaser his team expects for his debut.

**Scene opens:** The stage manager gives him the one-minute signal. The legendary curtain is about to rise. The announcer is reading his introduction. The crowd is roaring. His manager gives him a thumbs-up from the wings. His setlist is on the floor by the microphone: "Kentucky Rain" and "Whiskey and Regret." But the melody of "Coal Dust Memories" is in his head. He can almost feel his grandmother's presence. The announcer finishes: "...please welcome, for his Grand Ole Opry debut, Alex Wilson\!" \[What song does he play first?\]

---

## 44\. Scenario: The Stalker (Age 23\)

**Setup:** A fan, who goes by the online handle "AlexsAngel," has become increasingly obsessive. At first, it was just intense social media comments. Then came detailed letters sent to his management. Now, things have escalated. She shows up at his gigs, staring from the front row without blinking. She somehow got his unlisted address and has been leaving "gifts" on his doorstep: a framed photo of herself, a single dead rose, a lock of her hair tied with a red ribbon.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Escalation:** His team files a restraining order, but she violates it immediately. One night, Alex comes home to find his apartment door unlocked. Nothing is stolen, but a new photo is on his pillow: it's of him, sleeping, clearly taken from inside his bedroom.

**The Choice:** The police say they can't do much until she physically harms him. His manager wants to hire a full-time security detail, which would mean giving up what little freedom he has left. Tommy wants to "go have a chat" with her, a Pikeville solution that will almost certainly end in jail time.

**Scene opens:** It's 2 AM. Alex is sitting in his dark living room, guitar across his lap, unable to sleep. A notification pops up on his phone. It's a live-stream alert from "AlexsAngel." He clicks it. The video is shaky, filmed from a parked car. It's pointed directly at his living room window. In the video's chat, she types: "He's awake. He's thinking about me. Soon he'll understand we're meant to be." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 45\. Scenario: The Vocal Injury (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex is in the middle of his first headlining national tour. It's a grueling schedule of 50 shows in 60 days. His voice, his most powerful instrument, is starting to give out. He's been pushing through the raspiness and pain, but during a soundcheck in Chicago, it happens: he goes for a high note and his voice cracks, then disappears into a pained whisper.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Diagnosis:** A top specialist in the city gives him the verdict: a hemorrhaged vocal cord. The prescription is devastating: six weeks of absolute vocal rest—no talking, no singing, nothing—followed by months of therapy. If he pushes it, the damage could be permanent.

**The Stakes:** Cancelling the tour would be a financial catastrophe for him and his entire crew. It would kill his career momentum and label him as "unreliable." His manager suggests using pre-recorded vocal tracks to lip-sync the rest of the tour, something Alex finds artistically abhorrent.

**Scene opens:** Alex is backstage in his dressing room, 30 minutes before showtime. 15,000 people are chanting his name. The doctor's report is on the table next to a bottle of whiskey. His tour manager walks in, holding an earpiece and a microphone. "I've loaded the tracks from the Nashville show," he says softly. "Nobody has to know. Just go out there and give them a show." The first notes of his opening song's intro begin to play over the arena's PA system. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 46\. Scenario: The Lost Relative (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex's identity as Rosie Walker's grandson is now public knowledge, confirmed by a major *Rolling Stone* feature. He's in the process of claiming her estate, including the rights to her unreleased songs. One week before the final legal hearing, a man named Jesse Walker comes forward.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Claim:** Jesse, a 50-year-old musician from Texas, claims to be Rosie Walker's secret son, from a relationship she had *before* she came to Nashville. He has letters and a faded photograph that seem to support his story. He files a legal challenge, claiming he is the rightful heir to the entire estate.

**The Media Circus:** The story explodes. "ROSIE'S SECRET SON?" is the headline on every entertainment site. Jesse is sympathetic, a struggling artist who just wants to know his mother's legacy. He publicly asks Alex for a DNA test to "unite their family."

**The Doubt:** Alex's lawyers are skeptical. They believe Jesse is a fraud, but the letters look authentic, and a legal battle could freeze the estate for years. The label sees a PR nightmare. The public is split.

**Scene opens:** Alex is in a conference room with his lawyers. On the table are copies of Jesse's evidence. His lawyer points to a photo of a young Rosie with a baby. "He looks convincing, Alex. A jury will love him. He's requested a meeting, without lawyers. Says he just wants to talk, musician to musician. It's a trap. But if you refuse, you look like you're hiding something." Alex's phone buzzes. It's a text from an unknown number: "Don't believe him. Your grandmother told me everything. Meet me. \- H.C." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 47\. Scenario: The Boone Ultimatum (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's been a year since Alex learned his mother's family, the wealthy Boones of California, were alive. After an initial, awkward meeting, he has kept his distance, determined to make it on his own. Now, he's hit a wall. His van has died, he's about to be evicted, and a promising record deal just fell through.

**Continuity check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\] (Scenario 21 is a potential import)

**The Offer:** His maternal grandmother, Patricia Boone, a formidable retired judge, flies to Nashville. She meets him for lunch at a place so fancy it makes him uncomfortable. She lays out an offer: The Boone family will set up a $5 million trust fund for him. It's his, no strings... with one exception.

**The Condition:** He must quit the "unseemly business of public performance." They will pay for him to get a law degree from Stanford. He can write music in his spare time, as a "gentleman's hobby." "Your mother was a scholar, Alexander," Patricia says, her voice kind but firm. "She would have wanted a respectable life for you, away from the kind of world that consumed your father and grandmother."

**The Ultimatum:** She gives him 24 hours to decide. Accept, and his financial struggles are over forever. Refuse, and the Boone family will cut off all contact, permanently.

**Scene opens:** Alex is back in his crappy apartment. The eviction notice is on the counter. His wallet is empty. A pristine, embossed business card from "Boone Family Investments" sits next to the eviction notice. On the back, his grandmother has written: "Make the right choice. For your mother." His guitar is in the corner, the strings dulled from a hundred open mics that led nowhere. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 48\. Scenario: The Unfinished Song (Age 24\)

**Setup:** While going through the notebooks from Rosie Walker's estate, Alex finds a hidden page. On it is a single, perfect verse and a half-finished chorus for a song titled "Shenandoah Sunrise." It's a song about finally finding peace after a lifetime of running. It's clearly the last song she ever tried to write, but it's incomplete.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Creative Dilemma:** The fragment is a work of genius. Alex feels an overwhelming urge to finish it, to collaborate with his grandmother across time. But he's terrified. Is it his place to put words in her mouth? What if he can't do it justice? Completing it feels both like an act of love and an act of sacrilege.

**The Pressure:** His producer, who knows about the fragment, is pushing him hard to finish it for his next album, seeing it as a guaranteed Grammy-winner and a massive publicity hook. "The song Rosie Walker's grandson finished\!"

**Scene opens:** It's 3 AM in the empty RCA Studio A. Alex has been sitting with his guitar for hours, staring at a photocopy of Rosie's handwritten lyrics. The melody is in his head, but the words for the second verse won't come. He feels like a fraud. He's about to pack it in when his phone lights up with a memory notification. It's a photo from five years ago: him and his MawMaw on her porch, the sun rising over the Kentucky hills. A line comes to him. The first line of the second verse. \[Does he write it down?\]

## 49\. Scenario: The Governor's Ball (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex has become a significant cultural figure in Tennessee and beyond. He is invited to perform at the Governor of Tennessee's Inaugural Ball—a prestigious, high-profile event. The governor is a moderate, but his party is pushing a controversial "Artistic Decency" bill that would censor song lyrics and defund arts education.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Factions:**

- **The Governor's Office:** Wants a clean, patriotic performance. They've "suggested" he play a specific set of his most uncontroversial hits.  
- **The Opposition Party:** Is pressuring him to use the stage as a platform to denounce the bill and the governor.  
- **An Activist Group:** Has threatened to protest outside and inside the event, potentially disrupting his performance if he doesn't make a strong statement.  
- **His Record Label:** Is terrified of him alienating half the state and has threatened to pull promotional support for his album if he gets "political."

**The Choice:** This isn't just a gig; it's a political minefield. He can play it safe, make a bold statement, or try to find a third way to speak his mind through his music. Every news camera in the state will be on him.

**Scene opens:** Alex is backstage in a tuxedo that feels like a costume. The governor has just come by to shake his hand. "We're all so proud of you, son. A real Tennessee success story," he'd said. "Looking forward to a great, unifying performance." Alex can hear the polite applause from the ballroom. The stage manager hands him a guitar. "You're on in two minutes, Mr. Wilson." In his pocket is a folded piece of paper with the lyrics to one of Rosie Walker's old, unreleased protest songs. \[What does he do?\]

## 50\. Scenario: The Crossroads (Age 26\)

**Setup:** Alex is at the top of his game. He has a critically acclaimed album, a loyal fanbase, and the respect of his peers. He is presented with two competing offers that represent two vastly different futures.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Offers:**

1. **The Vegas Residency:** A five-year, $100 million contract to be the resident headliner at a new Las Vegas casino. He would play the same 90-minute greatest hits show, five nights a week. It is immense wealth and security, but it's the definition of selling out—a comfortable, creative death.  
2. **The Independent Label:** His hero, a legendary and fiercely independent artist (like a Jason Isbell or Sturgill Simpson type), has offered to partner with him to start a new, artist-owned record label. It would be a financial struggle, a constant grind, and he'd be turning his back on mainstream stardom. But it would give him complete creative freedom for the rest of his life.

**The Final Choice:** He has one week to decide. The choice will define his legacy. Will he be an entertainer or an artist? Rich or free?

**Scene opens:** Alex is standing on the porch of the small cabin outside Nashville he finally bought. The Vegas contract, a document as thick as a phone book, is on the table inside. His phone rings. It's the independent artist. "So, what do you say, kid?" he asks. "You want to go build something real, or you wanna go play dress-up for the tourists?" From the road, Alex can see the faint glow of the Nashville skyline. He thinks of Pikeville, of the mine, of his grandmother hiding from the very fame he now holds in his hands. \[What does he say?\]

## 51\. Scenario: The Ghost of Blackberry Creek (Age 18\)

**Setup:** It's late August, 2023\. Alex is 18\. His abusive father, David, drank himself to death a month ago. With no other family, Alex is utterly alone. He's retreated to the one place he feels safe: the stretch of Blackberry Creek behind his father's derelict trailer. He is practically feral, living off the land—trapping, fishing, and tending a small garden. He is self-sufficient, silent, and entirely separate from the world.

His only companion is a beat-up workhorse guitar he saved for years to buy. He's never played for another living soul. Every evening, as the sun sets, he sits on a flat rock by the water and plays the songs he's been writing since he was a boy. It's not a performance; it's a ritual. It's how he breathes.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Catalyst:** Liam Hayes, a veteran journalist for *Rolling Stone*, and Sarah Jenkins, a celebrated photographer, are in Pikeville for a generic feature on "The Enduring Spirit of Appalachian Music." They're bored, the story is cliché, and they're about to wrap it up. On their last day, looking for some final B-roll shots of nature, they follow a small path down to Blackberry Creek.

**The Discovery:** Through the trees, they see him. A young man who looks like a forgotten god, shirtless, with muscles carved from work, not a gym. He's sitting on a rock, singing a song that stops them both in their tracks. His voice is a raw, beautiful ache—pure, untrained, and devastatingly honest. Sarah raises her camera instinctively, the telephoto lens capturing images that she knows, with a jolt, are career-defining. Liam quietly turns on his field recorder.

They approach him after the song. Alex, startled and wary, is disarmingly polite. He has no idea what *Rolling Stone* is and assumes they're just friendly hikers. He answers their questions with a simple, unguarded honesty, telling them about his dad, the creek, and how the songs are "just something to do so the quiet don't get too loud." They spend an hour with him, then leave. Alex forgets about them the next day.

**The Fallout (Three Weeks Later):** Liam Hayes scraps the puff piece. He writes a passionate, almost mythic cover story about the "Ghost of Blackberry Creek." Sarah Jenkins' photos are breathtaking. The editors at *Rolling Stone* know they have something extraordinary. They put him on the cover.

**The Headline:** **"MEET ALEX WILSON: The Greatest Singer Alive is an 18-Year-Old Orphan Living by a Creek in Kentucky"**

### **Opening Scene: The World Finds Alex**

**Date:** September 21, 2023, 11:15 AM **Location:** Murphy's Bar, Pikeville, KY

The screen door of Murphy’s Bar groans open and bangs shut. Alex squints as his eyes adjust to the dim, beer-scented interior. He hasn't been to town in two weeks. He sets a bundle of cleaned catfish on the bar.

"Eddie," he says, his voice raspy from disuse. "Need to trade for some salt and flour."

Eddie Murphy, who has known Alex his whole life and slipped him free meals as a kid, is about to answer when the door slams open again. It’s Tommy Harlan's dad, holding a magazine like it's a winning lottery ticket.

"Eddie, you seen this? Holy God, you seen this?" He slaps the magazine down on the bar, right next to the fish.

Alex glances at it. On the cover is a photograph of him. He’s shirtless, sitting on his rock by the creek, eyes closed, head tilted back as if in prayer or pain. The sunlight hits the water behind him, making it sparkle like diamonds. He looks impossibly beautiful and completely lost. Above the iconic red logo, the headline screams at him.

Eddie stares from the magazine cover to the quiet, dusty boy standing in front of him. "Alex... what in the hell is this?"

"I... I don't know," Alex says, genuinely confused. He touches the glossy paper. "They were just some people. They were nice. They said they liked my song."

The old rotary phone behind the bar starts to ring, shrill and insistent. Eddie ignores it. He opens the magazine. The first page is a two-page spread of another of Sarah’s photos—a close-up of Alex’s face, haunted and intense.

"It says here," Eddie reads, his voice a stunned whisper, "that you're 'a phantom... a voice that America has been waiting for without knowing it.' It says you might be the most important artist of your generation."

The phone continues its frantic ringing. Now Eddie's cell on the counter starts buzzing, vibrating against a beer stein. A couple of old-timers at a corner table are staring, whispering. One of them pulls out his phone, taps the screen, and his jaw drops.

"It's everywhere," the man says. "It's on the news."

Alex feels a cold dread creep up his spine. The photo, the words, the ringing phones—it feels like an invasion. Those people hadn't been nice; they had been hunting. They took the one thing that was his, the one private thing in his world, and they showed it to everyone. His sanctuary was now a headline.

He backs away from the bar. "I gotta go," he mumbles, his throat tight.

"Wait, kid\!" Eddie calls out, but Alex is already pushing the door open, desperate for the familiar quiet of the trees. He runs out into the glaring sunlight, heading for the woods.

But this time, the world knew exactly where he was running.
