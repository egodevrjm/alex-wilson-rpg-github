# New York City Music Ecosystem

## Core Identity
Compressed vertical hustle. Rent pressure enforces multi‑gig stacking: day job → session → late set → dawn mastering notes. Momentum is measured in subway taps and rapidly forwarded links.

## Label / Corporate Hubs
* **Sony Music (Madison Ave)** – Elevators filled with legal/marketing chatter; fingerprint scanners beep softly.
* **Warner Music Group (Financial District)** – Open floors with river reflections; subdued corporate hush.
* **Downtown Music Holdings** – Catalog analytics dashboards; rights managers comparing metadata anomalies.

## Studios
| Studio | Specialty | Scene Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Electric Lady** | Heritage rock + modern alt | Psychedelic murals; faint incense swirls |
| **Power Station (Avatar)** | Live rooms, jazz + pop | Brass cases lining hallway |
| **Jungle City** | Luxury pop/hip‑hop | Rooftop skyline selfies before take 1 |
| **Sear Sound** | Vintage gear fidelity | Tape reel squeak + meticulous log sheets |

## Venue Layers
* **Emerging / Showcase** – **Rockwood Music Hall (Stage 1/2/3)**, **Pianos**, **Mercury Lounge**, **Baby’s All Right**, **Pete’s Candy Store**.
* **Indie / Mid** – **Bowery Ballroom**, **Music Hall of Williamsburg**, **Brooklyn Made**, **Elsewhere**, **Brooklyn Steel**.
* **Genre Pillars** – **Village Vanguard**, **Blue Note**, **Birdland**, **Nublu**.
* **Large Scale** – **Madison Square Garden**, **Barclays Center**, **Radio City Music Hall**, **Apollo Theater**.
* **Sensory Hooks** – Subway rumble under Bowery Ballroom; narrow green room couch at Mercury; Village Vanguard’s low ceiling pressing cymbal wash downward.

## Neighborhood Micro‑Ecosystems
| Area | Dominant Energy | Grounded Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lower East Side** | Indie grit | Wet sidewalk + late kitchen garlic vent |
| **Williamsburg** | Polished indie/electro | Boutique pedalboards + oat lattes |
| **Bushwick** | DIY / techno | Warehouse fog fluid odor |
| **Harlem** | Gospel, jazz heritage | Church rehearsals spilling onto sidewalk |
| **Bed‑Stuy** | Emerging hip‑hop / neo‑soul | Corner store bass bleed |
| **Long Island City** | Rehearsal loft spillover | Freight elevator clang |
| **Midtown** | Corporate meetings | Fluorescent hallway hum |

## Realistic Constraints
* Freight elevator delays eat load‑in window.
* 1:30 AM last subway compromises post‑show networking; decision: pay rideshare vs. eat net profit.
* Noise complaints truncate rooftop vocal takes at 9:58 PM.
* Winter dryness cracking acoustic guitar bridge pin—emergency humidifier run.

## Operational Friction Seeds
1. Pressing plant delay pushes vinyl release week after planned show.
2. Reviewer appears unexpectedly—band retools set pacing mid‑show.
3. Square reader offline; manual card entry backlog forming.
4. Licensing email: sample clearance conditional on 15% publishing share—overnight decision needed.
