## Description
An upbeat Appalachian country-rock anthem celebrating simple pleasures and good fortune. "Spear and a Wish" blends rural folk storytelling with radio-friendly hooks, featuring deep, gravel-warm vocals layered with a distinct Kentucky twang. The song builds from laid-back verses depicting Kentucky creek fishing under the moonlight to rowdy, shout-along choruses. It features a driving acoustic guitar riff, bouncy bassline, whimsical fiddle melodies, and a sliding steel guitar that evokes the landscape. Steady kick drums, subtle handclaps in the choruses, and light percussion suggest the gentle splashes of a creek, contributing to the fun, escapist mood. A mid-tempo bounce (132 BPM) makes it perfect for summer drives and communal singalongs, capturing the essence of freedom and luck with a gritty yet lighthearted feel.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Down in the holler where the creek runs clear,
Grab my ol' spear, crack a cold beer.
Moonlight dancin' on the water's edge,
Giggin' for catfish, livin' on the ledge.
Kentucky summer, fireflies aglow,
Wadin' in deep where the wild things go.

Chorus
With a spear and a wish, under starry skies,
Catchin' them fish with a gleam in my eyes.
Splashin' and laughin', feelin' so free,
In this ol' creek, just my luck and me.
Hey now, hey now, let the good times roll,
Spear and a wish, feedin' my soul!

Verse 2
Pawpaw trees swayin', bullfrogs croon,
Tossin' that spear by the light of the moon.
Wishin' for nothin' but a bite on the line,
Or maybe a sweetheart to call all mine.
Barefoot and grinnin', no worries in sight,
Just me and the water on a Friday night.

Chorus
With a spear and a wish, under starry skies,
Catchin' them fish with a gleam in my eyes.
Splashin' and laughin', feelin' so free,
In this ol' creek, just my luck and me.
Hey now, hey now, let the good times roll,
Spear and a wish, feedin' my soul!

Bridge
When the day's been long and the work's been tough,
This creek's my heaven, callin' my bluff.
One lucky thrust, and the supper's won,
Wish granted easy under the settin' sun.
The fireflies wink, the crickets all chime,
Washin' away the worries, one cast at a time.

Chorus
With a spear and a wish, under starry skies,
Catchin' them fish with a gleam in my eyes.
Splashin' and laughin', feelin' so free,
In this ol' creek, just my luck and me.
Hey now, hey now, let the good times roll,
Spear and a wish, feedin' my soul!

Outro
Yeah, spear and a wish, that's the Kentucky way,
Giggin' in the creek 'til the break of day.
Spear and a wish, yeah, come what may!
(Fade out with ad-libs: "Hey now!", "Creek time!", "Spear and a wish!")

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (driving riff), electric bass (bouncy, melodic), fiddle (whimsical melodies, solos in instrumental breaks), steel guitar (sliding fills and textures), drums (steady kick and snare), handclaps (in choruses), light percussion (shakers, tambourine). Vocals: Deep, gravelly male lead with Kentucky twang; backing vocals in choruses for shout-along effect. Arrangement: Song builds dynamically from laid-back verses to energetic choruses. Consider a fiddle solo after the second chorus and a steel guitar solo after the bridge. The outro fades out with ad-libs from the band, creating a sense of communal joy and spontaneity. Tempo: 132 BPM. Key: G Major. Mood: Fun, escapist, lighthearted, celebratory. Consider a key change up a whole step for the final chorus to add intensity.
