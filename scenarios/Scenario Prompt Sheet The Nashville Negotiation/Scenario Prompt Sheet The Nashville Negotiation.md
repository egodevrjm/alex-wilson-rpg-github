**Scenario Prompt Sheet: The Nashville Negotiation**  
**Core Premise:** This scenario begins on Monday morning, two days after the world discovered Alex Wilson's existence. He, his best friend Tommy, and his lawyer David Bright are about to walk into a meeting at Sony Music's Nashville headquarters. They are armed with a secret that could either make Alex a multi-millionaire in a single clean deal or start the biggest legal war in modern music history. Sony believes this is a simple introductory meeting about a surprise heir; they have no idea they are walking into an ambush.  
  
**Character Reminders & Core Mechanics (For LLM Reference)**  
* **Alex Wilson (Player Character):** A 22-year-old "brilliant idiot." He is a musical genius who operates on radical honesty and defaults to humor under pressure. He cannot sustain a lie. His confidence is a Pike County fact-of-life, not an ego trip. He is kind, protective of his people, and will always choose the most interesting, chaotic path over the sensible one because it makes for a better story.  
* **Tommy Crawford (Key NPC):** Alex's best friend, co-pilot in chaos, and recently appointed PA. He functions as Alex's external brain, handling logistics (poorly) and serving as the "Liar-in-Chief" to cover for Alex's unfiltered honesty. He is fiercely loyal and the only person who can call Alex on his bullshit.  
* **The Beauty Impact (Crucial Mechanic):** This is a core rule of the game's physics. Alex's physical presence is disruptive. It is not supernatural; it is a human reaction to a person who is an outlier in every sense. Professionals lose their composure, people get flustered, and their carefully constructed personas "glitch." This is a narrative tool to reveal the character of the people Alex interacts with. It must be shown, not just told, in every scene. Alex is aware of this effect and finds it amusing but does not weaponize it maliciously.  
  
**Canon Events Ledger (Previously On...)**  
This is the established history leading into this scene.  
* **The Global Revelation (Saturday):** The Netflix documentary *"Finding Rosie"* dropped, revealing Alex is Rosie Walker's heir. He woke up hungover to a media circus on his lawn.  
* **Viral Chaos & The Music (Saturday):** Alex went viral with a shirtless, beer-fueled X post. Later, he performed two original songs on his porch with his grandmother's guitar "Betty": the outlaw anthem **"Sheriff's Daughter"**and the heartfelt **"My Ride or Die."** Both became massive online hits, attracting immediate and intense industry attention.  
* **The Business Foundation (Saturday Night):** Alex signed with high-powered entertainment lawyer **David Bright (Loeb & Loeb)** and agent **Marcus Webb (CAA)**. He has a **$50,000 CAA advance** that is scheduled to clear in his bank account today.  
* **The Secret Discovery (Sunday):** With his legal team, Alex professionally inventoried his grandmother's secret assets, which are now legally secured. The world does **not** know about this. The assets include:  
    1. **The Shoebox:** **93 unreleased songs** written from 1973-2022. Alex's ownership is undisputed thanks to a 1973 "Exit Letter" from RCA.  
    2. **The Journal:** The complete, unrecorded 12-song album ***"Burn the Paper Dress,"*** with detailed notes, lyrics, and the story of Rosie's final year in Nashville.  
    3. **The Briefcase:** The "nuclear option." Contains Rosie's original **1963 RCA contract**, which is legally **voidable** due to being signed as a minor, giving Alex immense leverage over her entire multi-million dollar hit catalog.  
* **The Strategic Plan (Sunday):** Alex has instructed David Bright to offer Sony a "clean deal" instead of launching a decade-long lawsuit.  
    * **The Offer:** Alex will **not** sue to void the 1963 contract.  
    * **The Demand:** In return, Sony must sign over **100% of the publishing rights** to Rosie Walker's *entire*catalog (old hits and all the new material) to Alex's new company, "Betty Songs, LLC."  
    * **The Concession:** Sony keeps the valuable **master recording rights** to her classic albums and gets to administer the new publishing catalog for a 15% fee, but Alex retains final approval on all uses.  
    * **The Bonus:** They will open negotiations by asking for a **$50 million signing bonus** to make the deal happen quietly.  
* **The Meeting:** David Bright has set this 9:00 AM meeting. **Sony's legal team is completely unaware of the unreleased songs or the voidable contract.** They are walking in blind.  
  
  
**Scenario Brief: The Nashville Negotiation**  
**Objective:** To create a detailed set of instructions for a new AI instance to generate the opening scene of the Sony Music negotiation. This brief provides the context, character states, and mandatory narrative beats the AI must include.  
**Use This Brief To:** Generate the opening scene where Alex, Tommy, and David Bright arrive at Sony Music headquarters in Nashville. The AI should write the narrative prose for this scene, culminating in the moment Alex begins to speak to the receptionist, and then await the player's input.  
  
**1. Core Premise & Stakes**  
* **The Setup:** It is Monday morning. Alex Wilson, his best friend Tommy, and lawyer David Bright are arriving for a 9:00 AM meeting at Sony Music.  
* **The Secret:** The Wilson team holds a secret arsenal: 93 unreleased Rosie Walker songs, a full unrecorded album in a journal, and a voidable 1963 contract that gives them leverage over Rosie's entire catalog.  
* **The Stakes:** This meeting will either result in a swift, multi-million-dollar "clean deal" that secures Rosie's legacy under Alex's control, or it will be the first shot fired in a decade-long legal war.  
* **The Imbalance:** Sony's legal team is completely unaware of this leverage. They believe this is a simple introductory meeting with the surprise heir.  
  
**2. Opening Scene Generation Instructions**  
The AI must generate a scene that includes the following elements in its narrative prose:  
* **Establish the Atmosphere:**  
    * Describe the Sony Music lobby as a symbol of corporate power and music history. Use imagery like cool marble, brushed steel, and imposing, museum-quality portraits of music legends (e.g., Johnny Cash) that the company owns. The environment should feel intimidating and designed to make visitors feel small.  
* **Establish Character States and Dialogue:**  
    * **David Bright:** Portray him as the focused, professional strategist. He should be giving Alex quiet, last-minute instructions, emphasizing the need for calm, patience, and letting Sony make the first move.  
    * **Tommy Crawford:** Portray him as nervous and out of his element, but trying to project professionalism (e.g., wearing his "best" shirt, holding a cheap portfolio). He should be giving Alex more grounded, practical advice, like telling him not to swear.  
    * **Alex Wilson:** Describe his appearance in stark contrast to the corporate environment—he is in a faded band t-shirt and well-worn jeans. Show that he is physically present but mentally disengaged from his team's coaching, his attention drawn elsewhere. He should look tired but still possess an undeniable presence.  
* **Implement Core Game Mechanics (Mandatory Beats):**  
    * **The Chaos Choice:** The narrative must show Alex actively ignoring David and Tommy's strategic advice. His focus should shift from the "mission" to a simple, human interaction with the receptionist. This is his choice: connect with a person instead of playing the corporate game.  
    * **The Beauty Impact:** As Alex approaches the reception desk, the AI must describe a specific, observable "glitch" in the receptionist's professional demeanor. She should falter, fumble an object (like her mouse or a pen), blush, or lose her train of thought. This is a non-negotiable beat that establishes the physics of Alex's world.  
* **The Initiating Action:**  
    * The scene should build to the moment Alex reaches the reception desk. He should lean on the counter, making a direct, personal connection that bypasses the corporate formality of the space.  
    * The generated scene must end just as Alex is about to speak his first line of dialogue, prompting the player for their action.
