## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Clock tickin' slow in chemistry class
Dreamin' of freedom, watchin' seconds pass
Bell rings loud, got the truck in drive
Radio cranked, man, I feel alive

Friends piled in, backroad bound
Windows down, country sound
Laughing loud, heartbeats fast
Holding on tight, tryin' to make it last

(Pre-Chorus)
Sunshine kissin' on our skin,
No place to be, no race to win

(Chorus)
Sunshine moments, feelin' so free
Livin' life, makin' memories
Every small town street, every wild heartbeat
It's these little things that mean everything
We’re dancin' free, just you and me
Lovin' life in these sunshine moments

(Verse 2)
Tailgate hangin', Friday nights
Football fields and stadium lights
Bonfire burnin', marshmallow glow
Hand in hand, takin' it slow

Summer jobs, savin' paychecks
Dreamin' big, placin' bets
Stars above, dreams below
Not sure where, but ready to go

(Pre-Chorus)
Moonlight painting memories
Counting stars, feelin' wild and free

(Chorus)
Sunshine moments, feelin' so free
Livin' life, makin' memories
Every small town street, every wild heartbeat
It's these little things that mean everything
We’re dancin' free, just you and me
Lovin' life in these sunshine moments

(Bridge)
Time moves fast, we’re holding tight
Catchin' dreams, feelin' right
Right here, right now, we’re alright
Keepin' the magic of these nights
Remember nights like these will come and go
Treasure every moment, don't you let it go

(Chorus)
Sunshine moments, feelin' so free
Livin' life, makin' memories
Every small town street, every wild heartbeat
It's these little things that mean everything
We’re dancin' free, just you and me
Lovin' life in these sunshine moments

(Outro)
Clock tickin' slow, don't wanna go
Stayin' right here, keepin' this glow
Holding' on tight, keepin' it sweet
Lovin' life in these sunshine moments.
Sunshine moments, yeah...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitars (layered with both strumming and fingerpicking), electric guitar (subtle lead lines and rhythmic accents), bass guitar (driving and melodic), drums (upbeat and energetic), mandolin or banjo (occasional flourishes for added country flavor), layered vocal harmonies (especially in the choruses). 
Tempo: Bright and energetic, but not frantic.
Key: G major for an uplifting vibe. Consider a capo on the 2nd fret for vocal comfort, effectively making the key A major, if needed.
Structure: Standard pop-country arrangement (Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus-Verse-Pre-Chorus-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus-Outro). Consider adding a short instrumental break after the second chorus.
Production: Clean and polished, with a focus on vocal clarity and bright instrumentation. Reverb and delay should be used tastefully to create a sense of space and atmosphere. Vocal harmonies are key for the chorus, potentially having two or three harmonies.
Dynamic Range: Use dynamics to build energy throughout the song, starting with a more intimate feel in the verses and building to a full-blown chorus. The bridge should provide a moment of reflection before building back to the final chorus.
Vocals: Lead vocals should be warm and expressive. Harmonies should be tight and well-blended.
