## Description
A cinematic country pop ballad begins with delicate acoustic guitar and airy pads, then welcomes rich, echoing electric guitars and gentle synth swells. Pulsing electronic beats give the verses motion. Choruses expand with layered harmonies, vibrant pedal steel, and detailed synth layers, culminating in a powerful finale with sweeping acoustic, electric, and electronic textures.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
You said you’d meet me halfway,
But the road kept changin’ names.
Every sign felt like a dare,
Every mile pulled me somewhere.
We lit a match in the middle of a downpour,
Danced like fools in a midnight war.
I swore we’d bend before we’d break,
Guess I was wrong about the give and take.

(Pre-Chorus)
And I’ve been floatin’ since you let go,
But the fall’s the only thing I know.

(Chorus)
Gravity wins, every time, every time,
Pulls me back where I can’t rewind.
Tried to outrun what we began,
But it’s written in the way I land.
Every high finds a low,
Every spark fades to smoke—
Guess gravity wins… and I let it.

(Verse 2)
Your name still hums in the wires,
Like a ghost in the telephone lines.
I keep pretending I’m lighter,
But I sink in the space you left behind.
Skyscrapers don’t touch the same sky,
Streetlights can’t fake a star’s shine.
Even the city feels like it knows,
I’m just waiting for the pull below.

(Pre-Chorus)
Every orbit turns to a dive,
No one beats the rules we’re tied inside.

(Chorus)
Gravity wins, every time, every time,
Pulls me back where I can’t rewind.
Tried to outrun what we began,
But it’s written in the way I land.
Every high finds a low,
Every spark fades to smoke—
Guess gravity wins… and I let it.

(Bridge)
If I could live in the weightless part,
I’d keep the rush without the fall.
But every breath’s another start,
And every start knows the end too well.
These days, I'm fighting to let go
Trying to find a place to stand 

(Final Chorus)
Gravity wins, every time, every time,
Pulls me back where I can’t rewind.
I’ve been a leaf, I’ve been the wind,
But I break where your hands have been.
Every high finds a low,
Every spark fades to smoke—
Guess gravity wins… and I let it.

(Outro)
Yeah, I let it…
And I’d let it again.
And I'd let it again...with you.

## Performance Notes

Key: E♭ Major (Capo on 3rd fret – D shapes for guitar warmth but polished in mix). Tempo: 96 BPM. The song's foundation lies in its contrast between intimacy and grandeur. Focus on creating a wide stereo image, especially during the choruses, using layered synths and vocal chops. The 808 sub bass should be felt more than heard, providing a subtle low-end rumble. Guitar parts should be meticulously crafted with attention to reverb and delay, aiming for a shimmering, ethereal quality. The steel/slide guitar, treated with shimmer reverb, adds a unique sonic texture reminiscent of ambient pop rather than traditional country. Vocals should be delivered with a sense of vulnerability and acceptance. In the bridge, consider a slight increase in vocal intensity and a more prominent acoustic guitar strum for added emotional impact. The final chorus should explode with energy, driven by doubletime hi-hat patterns and wide stereo synth swells. Pay attention to dynamic contrast throughout the song, building gradually towards the climactic final chorus. Consider adding subtle autotune or formant shifting to the vocal chops to create a more robotic, futuristic sound.
