# Alex Wilson Solo Act - Pop Music Scenarios (2025) [REVISED]

## Scenario Framework

Each scenario should include:
- **Initial Stats**: Starting cash, followers, energy levels
- **Key NPCs**: Fully realized characters with their own agendas
- **Context-Driven Choices**: Where Alex's background shapes his options
- **Industry Reality**: Actual contracts, money, consequences
- **Nuanced Outcomes**: Success and failure aren't binary

## Dynamic Elements (Choose 2-3 per scene, not all):
- Beauty reactions when contextually appropriate (first meetings, performances)
- Musical expression when he's processing emotions
- Bureaucratic confusion with specific systems (not general incompetence)
- Honest communication that's situationally driven (not constant)
- Connection moments that feel genuine (not always romantic)

## 1. THE BOYBAND MUTINY
**Year: 2025 | Alex Age: 21 | Setting: LA/Nashville**

### Initial State
- **Cash**: $2,400 | **Bank**: $180
- **Followers**: X: 3.2K | IG: 8.7K | TikTok: 12K | YT: 890
- **Location**: NoHo apartment, sharing with two musicians
- **Context**: Two years in Nashville, grinding steadily, just called to LA

### The Setup
Danny Sanchez is assembling "Fifth & Main" - a boyband of real musicians who write. The other four trained together for months. Alex is the wildcard, scouted from a Douglas Corner Cafe video where he played [ask player for song].

### The Real Conflict
It's not that Alex is chaotic - it's that he doesn't understand the manufactured nature of boybands. He thinks they're actually going to write music together. He's confused why there's choreography for a song about heartbreak.

### Week 1: Rehearsals
Alex shows up on time, prepared, with Betty. Confusion starts when:
- "Why are we learning someone else's songs?"
- "I brought some stuff I wrote" (It's devastating, makes choreographer cry)
- Photographer keeps centering him without realizing

**His Competence Shows**: He learns harmonies instantly, helps others with pitch, suggests arrangement changes that actually improve songs.

### Week 2: The Contract Meeting
Republic Records offers unequal split. Alex genuinely doesn't understand:
- "Wait, why would I get more? We're a group."
- Not being noble, literally doesn't grasp why beauty = more money
- When explained, his response: "That's fucking weird."

### The Gradual Breakdown
Not instant chaos, but growing friction:
- Alex keeps writing real songs while others learn routines
- He bonds with Jaden (the producer) over actual music
- Tyler starts opening up to him about being closeted
- Marcus's resentment builds as Alex accidentally excels

### Potential Endings
1. **The Learning Curve**: Alex figures out the game, decides to play it differently. Uses spotlight to showcase others.
2. **The Bridge Builder**: His honesty breaks down fake barriers, band becomes real friends, changes trajectory.
3. **The Exit Strategy**: Realizes this isn't music, it's product. Leaves but takes Jaden with him to make real art.

**Starting Prompt**: "Danny's assistant is outside at 5 AM. You've been up since 4:30 writing. You grab Betty and the notebook where you've been working on harmonies for the group."

## 2. AMERICAN IDOL: THE TRANSLATION PROBLEM
**Year: 2025 | Alex Age: 20 | Setting: Nashville â†’ Hollywood**

### Initial State
- **Cash**: $340 | **Bank**: $0
- **Followers**: X: 1.2K | IG: 2.3K | TikTok: 5K | YT: 230
- **Location**: Rotating between F-150 and couch surfing
- **Context**: One year in Nashville, still processing grandmother's death

### The Real Story
Alex auditions because Emma (Acme waitress) recognizes his talent. His song about his father who died when he was **15** resonates. Producers see ratings, but Alex just wants people to hear the song.

### The Disconnect
Not that Alex can't perform - he's brilliant at that. It's that he doesn't understand:
- Why they need his trauma packaged in specific ways
- The concept of "journey narrative"
- Why crying on cue matters more than the song

### His Actual Behavior

**Hollywood Week**: Excels at music, confused by everything else
- Helps other contestants with arrangements
- Shares his food with broke competitors  
- Genuinely asks: "Why is there voting? Can't multiple people be good?"

**Producer Interactions**: 
- "Can you cry about your dad?"
- Alex: "I mean, sometimes I do. Not really on command though. Do you cry about your dad on command?"

### Performance Reality
When he sings, he's transcendent. When they try to package him, he's genuinely confused, not rebellious. He's trying to understand their language but it doesn't translate.

### Voting Patterns
- Young people love his authenticity
- Older viewers split: either think he's "disrespectful" or refreshingly honest
- He doesn't understand how to campaign for votes

### Potential Endings
1. **The Education**: Alex learns about the machine while maintaining himself. Wins by being real.
2. **The Noble Exit**: Leaves when asked to fake something about his father. Gains respect, loses competition.
3. **The Compromise**: Finds middle ground - gives them enough story while protecting his truth.

## 3. OPENING ACT: THE COMPETENCE PARADOX
**Year: 2025 | Alex Age: 22 | Setting: 40-city arena tour**

### The Reality
Alex CAN do the tour. He's been gigging for three years. The issue isn't chaos - it's different priorities.

### Daily Reality

**What He Does Successfully:**
- Shows up for soundcheck (just not always on time)
- Performs brilliantly every night
- Connects with fans genuinely
- Writes constantly between shows

**What Confuses Him:**
- Media training ("Why can't I just answer honestly?")
- Corporate meet-and-greets ("Do these people actually care about music?")
- The difference between bus call and lobby call
- Why there's a schedule for "free time"

### Tour Evolution

**Week 1-2**: Tour manager Emma thinks he's deliberately difficult
**Week 3-4**: Realizes he literally doesn't understand tour hierarchy
**Week 5-6**: Develops systems that work for both (texts him photos of where to be)

### The Sabrina Dynamic
She watches him perform every night because he's genuinely incredible. Not threatened, but fascinated by someone who can't fake anything. Becomes protective of him.

### Critical Moments

**Atlanta**: Gets lost, ends up at wrong venue. Still makes it in time, performs brilliantly.

**Chicago**: Helps Sabrina with arrangement problem she's been struggling with. She realizes he's a genius, just different.

**MSG**: Plays impromptu set for venue staff at 2 PM. Video goes viral. Sabrina posts: "This is what music is actually about." [ask player for song]

### Endings
1. **The Mentorship**: Sabrina takes him under wing, teaches him systems while learning his authenticity.
2. **The Partnership**: Becomes creative collaborator, not just opener.
3. **The Launch**: Her endorsement makes him undeniable, career takes off independently.

## 4. THE VIRAL MOMENT: SUCCESS VS. UNDERSTANDING
**Year: 2025 | Alex Age: 20 | Setting: Nashville**


### The Feeding Frenzy

**What He Understands:**
- People like the song
- He needs money for rent
- Labels want to meet him

**What He Doesn't:**
- Why everyone needs him to sign NOW
- What "360 deal" means
- Why they keep saying "strike while hot"
- The difference between gross and net

### Meeting Realities

**CAA Rep**: Alex asks genuine questions she can't answer honestly
- "But why do you get 10% if I do the work?"
- "What exactly are you representing?"

**Columbia Records**: He's brilliant in showcase, lost in negotiation
- Plays 5 songs that make executives cry
- Can't understand contract despite three explanations
- "Can my friend who went to college read this?"

**Calvin Klein**: They want his face. He's confused.
- "For what? I'm not a model."
- "You want to pay me to wear clothes? I already wear clothes."

### The Sarah Kim intervention
Former A&R who sees what's happening. Explains in language he understands:
- "They're buying your future music before you make it"
- "You'll owe them money even if you make them money"
- Teaches him basic contract reality

### Endings
1. **The Education**: Sarah helps him navigate, gets fair(er) deal
2. **The Indie Route**: Takes less money for more freedom, builds slowly
3. **The Reset**: Waits too long, moment passes, but learns valuable lessons

## 5. THE TINY DESK: WHERE DIFFERENT IS THE POINT
**Year: 2025 | Alex Age: 22 | Setting: Washington D.C.**

### Why This Works
NPR Tiny Desk is the one place where Alex's approach aligns perfectly with the platform's values. No production, no fakeness, just truth.

### The Discovery
Bobby Carter finds Alex not through industry channels but SoundCloud at 3 AM. Recognizes something unmanufactured. Bob Boilen agrees: "Document this before the industry changes it."

### The Journey
- Drives 11 hours alone (competent)
- Arrives on time (capable)
- Confused by technical setup (specific gap)
- Brilliant when performing (genius)

### The Performance

**What Makes It Special:**
- He talks to the crew like people, not "NPR staff"
- Explains songs simply: "This is about my dad. He died when I was 15."
- Forgets cameras are rolling, asks genuine questions
- The intimacy is accidental and devastating

### The Impact
Goes viral not for chaos but for authenticity. People recognize something real in an ocean of manufactured content.

### The Aftermath

**Industry Response:**
- Labels want him but he takes time to decide
- Finds Jagjaguwar, indie label that gets him
- They build support system around his strengths

**Career Reality:**
- Small venues where he can connect
- Records when inspired, not on schedule
- Makes enough to live, not enough to lose himself
- Still himself, just with health insurance

This works because it's not about Alex failing or succeeding - it's about finding the space where his kind of intelligence is actually the advantage.

---

## Core Scenario Principles

### He's Not Broken, He's Different
- Alex succeeds when his intelligence type matches the situation
- He struggles when forced into systems built for different kinds of minds
- His "chaos" is usually just different priorities
- His honesty isn't performative, it's his only mode

### Competence Shows In:
- Musical situations
- One-on-one connections
- Problem-solving that requires intuition
- Physical/mechanical tasks
- Reading emotional dynamics

### Confusion Shows In:
- Corporate/legal language
- Hierarchical structures
- Abstract financial concepts
- Long-term planning
- Social performance requirements

### The Real Story
These scenarios aren't about a beautiful disaster stumbling through the music industry. They're about someone with extraordinary gifts and specific trauma trying to succeed in an industry built for people who learned different lessons at different dinner tables.

The friction isn't that Alex can't function. It's that his function doesn't match their system. Sometimes that's a problem. Sometimes it's a superpower. Always, it's human.

## Starting Scenarios

Pick any scenario and begin with Alex in a moment of competence - writing, performing, helping someone - then introduce the system friction. Let his traits emerge naturally from context, not force them into every scene.

Remember: He survived alone from 19 to now. That takes intelligence, resourcefulness, and capability. Honor that in every scene.
