Following the seismic success of her feminist manifesto, *Good Girls Go to Heaven*, Rosie Walker embarked on what would become the most legendary and epic tour of the era. The 1970-1971 "Gospel & Grit Revival Tour" was less a series of concerts and more a cultural pilgrimage, cementing her status as a global icon whose influence rivaled that of any rock band on the planet. This was not just a tour to support an album; it was a fiery, two-year sermon on defiance, independence, and the power of a woman armed with a guitar and the truth.

The scale was unprecedented. Moving beyond arenas, Rosie booked stadiums and headlined international festivals, commanding crowds of over 50,000. The stage itself was a spectacle—a fusion of a smoky, neon-lit honky-tonk and an apocalyptic revival tent, complete with gothic arches and a single, stark microphone stand. Every night, she didn't just perform; she held court, delivering her outlaw gospel with an intensity that became the stuff of legend. This tour would be her final, defiant roar before the silence.

The "Gospel & Grit Revival Tour" was Rosie Walker's magnum opus. It was on this tour that she famously declared from the stage each night before launching into "Good Girls Go to Heaven," **"They say good girls go to heaven, but bad girls get to go everywhere else first."** This tour was her everywhere—a blaze of glory so bright it would illuminate her legend through the decades of silence that would follow.
