## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Water licked the porch-rail, climbed to kiss the window-pane
Took my photographs and songbooks, left the rafters rust-stained
But even when the river swallows every word I ever knew
There’s a higher ground that’s callin’, and I’m walkin’ there with you

[Chorus]
Hallelujah on the hillside, hallelujah in the mud
When the night sky cracks with thunder and the creek turns into blood
Raise a lantern to your neighbor, let the lost ones see it too
High-ground hallelujah—I’ll sing it home with you

[Verse 2]
Mama’s Bible’s water-wrinkled, pages stuck in Revelation
Daddy’s boots float by like ghosts of coal-dust generations
But the sparrow’s still rejoicin’ on the single line of wire
If that feathered thing keeps singin’, then this heart can stoke a fire

[Chorus]
Hallelujah on the hillside, hallelujah in the mud
When the night sky cracks with thunder and the creek turns into blood
Raise a lantern to your neighbor, let the lost ones see it too
High-ground hallelujah—I’ll sing it home with you

[Bridge]
We ain’t promised dry land, we ain’t promised gold
Just a borrowed breath of mountain air and each other’s hands to hold
So let the water rise, let the heavens weep and moan,
We’ll find our salvation in this song, this hill, this home.

[Chorus]
Hallelujah on the hillside, hallelujah in the mud
When the night sky cracks with thunder and the creek turns into blood
Raise a lantern to your neighbor, let the lost ones see it too
High-ground hallelujah—I’ll sing it home with you

[Outro]
Hallelujah...Hallelujah...Walkin' on higher ground...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked style), upright bass (arco and pizzicato), brushed snare drums, subtle organ swells (Leslie speaker effect), soft piano chords (sustaining pedal), pedal steel guitar (gentle bends and volume swells), restrained banjo (clawhammer style in bridge), close vocal harmonies (primarily in choruses). Tempo: Slow and deliberate, allowing the emotional weight of the lyrics to resonate. Dynamics: Gradual crescendo throughout the song, building to a powerful, yet restrained final chorus. The banjo in the bridge offers a moment of hopeful levity before the final, powerful reiteration of the chorus. Key: G Major is recommended for its bright and hopeful quality, and suitability for acoustic instruments. Performance Note: Encourage close vocal harmonies. The brushed snare is crucial in delivering a gentle, yet driving rhythm. The banjo is optional, but it should be performed with restraint, reinforcing the hopeful mood without overpowering the other instruments. The outro should gently fade out, leaving the listener with a sense of peace and resilience.
