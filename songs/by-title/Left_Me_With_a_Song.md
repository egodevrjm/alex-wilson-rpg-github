## Description
A bittersweet pop-country ballad about finding solace in songwriting after a painful breakup. Alex Wilson's soulful, raspy vocals, tinged with a drawl, deliver a poignant narrative of heartache and resilience. Set against a backdrop of soft acoustic guitar picking, weeping pedal steel swells, subtle drums, and delicate fiddle accents, the song captures the mood of rainy afternoons and empty rooms, transforming personal sorrow into a universal anthem of healing and self-discovery. Mid-tempo (84 BPM) rhythms and introspective verses build to emotionally charged choruses with layered harmonies, while a vulnerable bridge offers a glimmer of hope amidst the lingering pain.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Soft acoustic guitar picking, slow tempo building to a mid-tempo country ballad, evoking a lonely porch at dusk with subtle pedal steel)

(Verse 1)
You packed your bags on a rainy afternoon,
Left the key on the table, walked out of the room.
Echoes in the hallway, silence in the air,
All our dreams scattered like dust everywhere.
I stared at the door, feelin' lost and small,
Heart in pieces, back against the wall.
But in the quiet, a melody started to play,
Turnin' pain into words I couldn't say.

(Pre-Chorus)
You took the love, the laughs, the light we shared,
But there's one thing you couldn't take from there.

(Chorus - Emotional, catchy hook with harmonies)
You left me with a song, playin' in my head,
Notes of what we had, words I never said.
A broken heart's rhythm, strummin' through the night,
Failed love's last echo, holdin' on so tight.
Yeah, you walked away, but the music stayed strong,
All I got now is this heartache turned song.
You left me with a song.

(Verse 2)
Memories replay like an old vinyl spin,
Your smile in the chorus, where do I begin?
The verse is our fights, the bridge is goodbye,
But the hook pulls me back, no matter how I try.
I sing to the stars, to the empty chair,
Findin' solace in strings, breathin' in the air.
What was once our story now lives in these lines,
A silver linin' in the tears sometimes.

(Pre-Chorus)
You took the future we planned hand in hand,
But left me a gift I can understand.

(Chorus - Building with full band, heartfelt delivery)
You left me with a song, playin' in my head,
Notes of what we had, words I never said.
A broken heart's rhythm, strummin' through the night,
Failed love's last echo, holdin' on so tight.
Yeah, you walked away, but the music stayed strong,
All I got now is this heartache turned song.
You left me with a song.

(Bridge - Music pulls back, intimate vocal with light guitar)
Maybe someday I'll play it for a crowd,
Turn this sorrow into somethin' proud.
But for now, it's mine, this melody of blue,
A reminder of love, and gettin' through.
And maybe you'll hear it, on the radio late,
And think of the fire we couldn't abate.

(Chorus - Soaring finale, emotional peak)
You left me with a song, playin' in my head,
Notes of what we had, words I never said.
A broken heart's rhythm, strummin' through the night,
Failed love's last echo, holdin' on so tight.
Yeah, you walked away, but the music stayed strong,
All I got now is this heartache turned song.
You left me with a song.

(Outro - Fades with acoustic echoes and pedal steel hum, vocal ad-libs)
Yeah, just a song...
(Just a song...)
Left me with a song.
(A melody...)
(Fade)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked), pedal steel guitar (subtle swells and sustained notes), light drums (brush work and minimal kick drum), fiddle (accent notes and melodic fills), bass guitar (simple, supportive lines), backing vocals (harmonies in chorus). Tempo: Mid-tempo ballad, approximately 84 BPM. Key: G Major. Dynamics: Build gradually from soft intro to soaring chorus. The bridge should be intimate and vulnerable, with minimal instrumentation. Outro: Fade out with prominent acoustic guitar echoes and sustained pedal steel hum. Vocals: Raspy, soulful male vocals with a slight drawl, emphasizing emotion and vulnerability. Ensure clear diction and heartfelt delivery. The pedal steel should mimic the vocal melody in some places for added emotional impact. Consider a key change up a whole step for the final chorus to further amplify the emotional intensity.
