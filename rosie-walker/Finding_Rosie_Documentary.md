---

### **00:00:00 — COLD OPEN (ARCHIVAL / AUDIO)**

**BLACK.**  
 A faint hiss. House mics crackle. Then a woman’s voice—steady, dangerous.

**ROSIE WALKER (archival, Opry):** “Bad girls go to Nashville, but smart girls go home.”

**SMASH CUT TO:** Audience gasp. A steel guitar whine. Tape wow.

**TITLE CARD (over black):**  
 *A Netflix Documentary*  
 **FINDING ROSIE**

**MUSIC CUE (instrumental):** A spare, reverent waltz motif, evoking “Baptized in Bourbon” (no lyrics).

---

### **00:01:22 — OPENING MONTAGE (ARCHIVAL \+ GRAPHICS)**

**B-ROLL:**  
 — 1960s Nashville marquees; RCA studio exterior; Opry crowd spilling onto Broadway.  
 — Newspaper clippings: “WILD CHILD SHAKES OPRY,” “WALKER TOPS CHARTS,” “SCANDAL AT GALA.” (graphic animations)

**LOWER-THIRD (super):** *Rosie Walker, “The Bad Girl of Nashville,” 1945–?*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “In a decade of rhinestones and radio kings, Rosie Walker burned hotter than anybody. Two \#1 albums. Pop crossover. Six Opry appearances—and thrown out of two. Then she was gone.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote, archival audio under still):**  
 **Dolly Parton (1994):** “Rosie had more talent in her pinky than most of us in our whole body. I still wonder what happened to her.”

---

### **00:03:45 — ACT I: THE STAR**

**INT. ARCHIVE STAGE — DAY (INTERVIEW)**  
 **HISTORIAN \#1 (on camera):**  
 “She hitchhiked to Nashville at seventeen, slept in Centennial Park, played outside Tootsie’s, and got signed to RCA within a year.”

**CUTAWAY:** B\&W photo of a teenage Rosie with a 1959 Martin D‑28, annotated “Betty.”

**HISTORIAN \#2 (on camera):**  
 “Her Opry debut in ’64—in pants—was a shockwave. She called high heels ‘shackles.’ That defiance never left.”

**B-ROLL:** LP jackets for *Baptized in Bourbon* (1968) and *Good Girls Go to Heaven* (1970); Billboard charts swinging up.  
 **NARRATOR (V.O.):** “*Baptized in Bourbon* hit \#1 Country and into the Pop Top 10; *Good Girls Go to Heaven* went \#1 Country, \#3 Pop.”

---

### **00:08:10 — ACT I.2: THE FIGHT**

**ARCHIVAL AUDIO (muffled gala chatter):** A glass clink; then a muttered “—fuck off.” **ON-SCREEN CAPTION:** *Industry Gala, 1970 (reported).*

**HISTORIAN \#3 (on camera):**  
 “She demanded producer credit before that was a thing for women here. Nashville didn’t forgive. She didn’t care.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote):**  
 **Willie Nelson (2001):** “We called ourselves outlaws, but Rosie was the real deal. She just vanished. Probably the smartest thing anyone ever did in this town.”

---

### **00:12:55 — ACT II: THE VANISHING**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “New Year’s Eve, 1972\. She rewrites the line on live radio, walks offstage, leaves a note—‘Contract fulfilled. –R’—and boards a Greyhound at 2 a.m. No farewell tour. No interviews. Nothing.”

**INSERT:** Close-up of the dressing-room note (recreation), then a Greyhound pulling away into night.

**HISTORIAN \#1 (on camera):**  
 “After that, it was theories. Europe. Witness protection. A grave with no marker. None of it ever stuck.”

---

### **00:16:20 — ACT III: THE MONEY**

**GRAPHIC EXPLAINER:** Contract animation shows “FLAT SALARY → LABEL OWNS: MASTERS, PUBLISHING, NAME.”  
 **NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “She was a global star on paper—but a salary artist in reality. The catalog thrived; the artist didn’t own the songs. Half a century later, playlists keep her alive. Her rights? Locked in corporate vaults.” (Context from label tenure and artist-rights fight.)

---

### **00:20:05 — ACT IV: THE FRAGMENT**

**EXT. LEXINGTON FLEA MARKET — DAY (RECREATED B‑ROLL)**  
 Gloved hands flip through milk‑crate ephemera. A torn page in looping script catches light.

**ON SCREEN (transcription over paper fibers):**  
 “**December 28, 1972 — Drove through Pikeville today. Mountains look like home somehow. Maybe because they are. Stop running, stop running, stop running. But I can’t go back. Not now. Not with—**” **\[Torn\]**

**NINA (Director, on camera):**  
 “I found it in a box of church bulletins and recipe cards. The handwriting matched Rosie’s set lists. It mentioned Pikeville. It mentioned leaving before anyone found out she was…” (Beat.) “We knew we had to follow it.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “For the first time in fifty years, a clue that wasn’t hearsay. A place. A date. A reason she might have run.”

---

### **00:24:40 — ACT IV.1: THE ROAD TO PIKEVILLE**

**EXT. U.S. 23 — WINTER DAY**  
 **DRONE:** Netflix van snakes through iced hollers.

**INT. MOTEL OFFICE — DAY**  
 **DARLA (motel manager, on camera):**  
 “You folks here for the Wilsons? There’s a boy plays all them Rosie Walker songs at Murphy’s. Tall drink of water. Looks like trouble.” (Laughs.)

**NINA (off):** “What’s his name?”  
 **DARLA:** “Alex. Alex Wilson.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “Pikeville. The name on Rosie’s fragment. A Wilson family. And a young man who keeps playing her songs.”

---

### **00:28:10 — ACT V: PAPER TRAIL**

**INT. PIKE COUNTY CLERK’S OFFICE — DAY**  
 **CAMERA:** Over-the-shoulder on brittle record books.

**NINA (V.O., reading):**  
 “Marriage certificate, March 1973—**Homer Wilson** and **Judith Wilson**.” (Beat.) “Judith.”

**GRAPHIC TIMELINE (animated):**  
 — **Dec 1972:** “Transformation.”  
 — **Mar 1973:** Marriage to Homer Wilson.  
 — **Sep 1973:** Birth of **David**.  
 — **1996:** Homer dies (black lung).  
 — **2005:** Abigail Boone dies giving birth to **Alex**.  
 — **2020:** David dies (liver failure).  
 — **2022:** Judith dies (lung cancer).  
 *All dates verified via local archives.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “Judith Wilson. Quiet wife. Never sang in public again. The records say she raised a grandson named Alex after tragedy took over.”

**HISTORIAN \#2 (on camera):**  
 “If Judith was Rosie—a new name, a quick marriage, a baby in ’73—that would explain a lot. The silence. The speed. The vanishing act.”

**ON‑SCREEN DISCLAIMER:** “No birth‑father named in public documents. Rumors involving a major country star remain unverified.”

---

### **00:36:00 — ACT V.1: THE LIVING ECHO**

**INT. WORKSHOP — DAY (INTERVIEW)**  
 **SESSION GUITARIST (on camera):**  
 “Rosie’s tone lived in a 1959 Martin D‑28. If Judith had ‘Betty’ in Pikeville… somebody learned on that soundboard.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “Judith reportedly gave her grandson a guitar at age seven and taught him to play.”

**CUTAWAY:** A hands‑only shot (face out of frame) brushing along an old spruce top.

---

### **00:41:25 — ACT VI: WITNESSES & CONSEQUENCES**

**EXT. MURPHY’S BAR — DUSK (establishing)**  
 Neon “OPEN,” frost on the windows.

**INT. LIVING ROOM — DAY (INTERVIEW)**  
 **NEIGHBOR \#1 (on camera):**  
 “Judith kept to herself. Sweet lady. Brought chess pie to funerals. But when Rosie came on the radio… she got quiet. Like listening to her own ghost.”

**CHYRON (pull-quote):**  
 **George Jones (1998):** “Rosie Walker? Hell of a talent… Don’t know where she went, but I hope she found peace.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “We requested comment from RCA about Rosie’s contract and royalties. The label declined to participate.” (Contextualizing her artist‑rights fight.)

---

### **00:49:10 — ACT VII: THE MAP POINTS HOME**

**INT. EDIT BAY — NIGHT**  
 Index cards: **PIKEVILLE** circled; **WILSON** underlined; **FRAGMENT** pinned with red string.

**NINA (on camera, to crew):**  
 “If Judith is Rosie, then David was Rosie’s son… and Alex is Rosie’s grandson. We can’t put this on camera until we’re sure. We need a face. A voice.”

**PRODUCER (off):** “Murphy’s Thursday. Open mic.”

---

### **01:01:38 — ACT VIII: THE GHOST IN THE MINE**

**EXT. BLACKBERRY MINE \#3 — DAWN**  
 Cage clanks. Steam breath in cold air. (We hold faces anonymous; consent not granted for the shift.)  
 **AMBIENT AUDIO:** Steel-toed boots on grate, the hum of machinery.

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “Pikeville works underground. Eighteen, nineteen, twenty‑two—boys become men under the mountain.”

**CUT TO:** A bare forearm lifting a thermos. A hand with guitar calluses wraps a railing.

---

### **01:10:30 — TITLE BUMPER**

**TEXT (white on black):**  
 *71:00 — Our investigation pivots.*

---

## **THE PIVOT**

### **01:11:00 — ACT IX: ENTER ALEX**

**EXT. MURPHY’S BAR — NIGHT**  
 Snow hisses in the neon haze. Cars nose into rutted gravel.

**INT. MURPHY’S — CONTINUOUS**  
 **CAM 1 (door angle):** The door opens. A tall silhouette fills the frame.  
 **ROOM TONE:** Loud—then, subtly, a hush.

**STAGE DIRECTION:** He steps in—six‑two, shoulders earned by work, waist narrow, a V cut under a thrift‑store denim jacket. The room reorganizes without meaning to. Conversations trail off. Eyes drag toward him.

**BARTENDER (whisper, caught on mic):** “Lord, would you look at that.”  
 **PATRON \#2 (to friend):** “Movie‑star face. Coal miner hands.”

**CHYRON (NOT SHOWN YET):** (We do not identify him on first entry.)

**CAM 2 (profile glide):** He crosses the room—no swagger he doesn’t carry by accident—guitar case in one hand. He nods at the soundman, easy grin, Kentucky charm that makes the corner table lean in.

**MC (off mic):** “We got Alex up next. Give him a hand.”

**OFF-CAMERA (local):** “He’s the Wilson boy Darla meant.”

---

### **01:12:40 — ACT IX.1: TUNING**

**SFX:** Case latches. The lid opens. A vintage Martin—wartime burst of spruce and rosewood—catches the red neon from a Miller sign.  
 A collective intake of breath from those who know guitars.

**SOUND MIX NOTE:** We mic the instrument, not the PA. The bar breath is the reverb.

**ALEX (off mic, to the room, casual):** “How y’all doin’?” (Easy as a grin. Someone giggles and doesn’t know why.)

**CAM 3 (tight on hands):** His right thumb brushes sixth string. A low, honeyed drone.

---

### **01:13:25 — ACT IX.2: THE SONG**

**TITLE (small corner super):** *Murphy’s Bar — Pikeville, KY — Thursday Open Mic.*

**MUSIC CUE (live performance):** He starts a slow waltz—minor‑key turn, then a lift to light. The melody unmistakable to anyone raised on AM radio in the hills.

**ON-SCREEN LOWER-THIRD (appears for viewers, not in room):**  
 *“Shenandoah Sunrise” (Rosie Walker) — arrangement by performer*  
 *(Lyrics redacted for program rights — performance excerpt cleared)*

**STAGE DIRECTIONS:**  
 — First phrase: the room stills.  
 — Second phrase: a woman at the rail covers her mouth.  
 — Third: the bartender forgets to pour.  
 — Chorus lift: he opens the top end, and that voice—whiskey‑and‑gravel with unexpected honey—pours out like a promise nobody remembers making.

**CUTAWAY:** Tommy—phone up, filming, trying not to cheer too loud. (We have location consent; we don’t identify him yet.)

**SOUND NOTE:** Audience hush becomes a pad beneath the voice. A chair creaks like a snare brush.

**NARRATOR (V.O., hushed):**  
 “Every jukebox knows this one. Every grandmother hums it while she cooks. But here, it sounds like a family secret being told out loud.”

---

### **01:15:45 — ACT IX.3: AFTERGLOW**

**SONG ENDS.** A beat—no one moves. Then the room exhales as one. Applause like relief.

**ALEX (into mic, grin sideways):** “Appreciate y’all.” (He drops his eyes, shy for the first time.)

**BAR PATRON (to camera, spontaneous):** “He… he’s stupid pretty. But when he sings it’s like the mountain’s talking through him.”

**CAM 1 (roaming):** Faces lit up, stunned, already telling each other who they were with when they heard it.

---

### **01:17:10 — ACT IX.4: INTERCUT — THE TRAIL CONVERGES**

**INT. EDIT BAY — NIGHT**  
 On a split‑screen we line up:  
 — Rosie’s handwritten “R” from the fragment.  
 — The marriage record: Judith \+ Homer, March ’73.  
 — Birth record: David, September ’73.  
 — Obituary clippings: Homer (1996), David (2020), Judith (2022).  
 — A DMV still: *Alexander Wilson*, Pike County, age 22\.  
 — A photo of **Betty** (Rosie’s 1959 D‑28) and a frame of Alex’s guitar at Murphy’s; side‑by‑side rosette matches.

**HISTORIAN \#3 (V.O.):**  
 “If Judith kept Rosie’s guitar and taught the boy on it… The sound would pass down. You’d hear the blood.”

---

### **01:18:50 — ACT X: THE CASE WE CAN MAKE**

**INT. STUDIO — DAY (INTERVIEW)**  
 **HANDWRITING EXAMINER (on camera):**  
 “The flea‑market fragment and Rosie’s set-list samples share stroke order, pressure patterns, terminal curves—overwhelmingly likely the same hand.”

**INT. COUNTY CLERK — DAY (INTERVIEW)**  
 **CLERK (on camera):**  
 “Judith Wilson, Pike County. Marriage March ’73. She kept to herself. Sweet woman.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “From Rosie to Judith. Judith to David. David to Alex.”

**ARCHIVAL AUDIO (pull-quote):**  
 **Chet Atkins (1980):** “I’ve forgiven everyone who ever wronged me. Except Rosie Walker.” (Half a chuckle.) “She owes me an apology and a new pair of shoes.”

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “Rosie never apologized. Maybe she went home instead.”

---

### **01:22:40 — ACT X.1: ETHICS CARD**

**BLACK CARD (white text):**  
 *We did not inform the performer of our conclusion while filming at Murphy’s. Consent for filming was obtained from the venue. We extended interview requests to the Wilson family after principal photography; there was no response by press time.*

---

### **01:23:10 — ACT XI: THE GHOST IN THE MINE (CODA MONTAGE)**

**EXT. BLACKBERRY MINE \#3 — DAWN (RETURN SHOT)**  
 Boots on steel, the cage descends—anonymous faces, anonymous lives.

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “In 1972, the biggest woman in country music changed one line, left a note, and vanished into the hills.”

**CUT TO:** Alex at Murphy’s laughing with friends, that gravitational ease bending the room toward him.  
 **NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
 “In 2025, in a bar the size of a good living room, a young man walked in, and every head turned. The voice sounded familiar.”

---

### **01:24:30 — FINAL REVEAL**

**BLACK.**  
 A long, deliberate beat. The bar’s room tone lingers in the dark.

**ON-SCREEN TEXT (one line at a time):**

**ALEX WILSON**  
 **Age 22 — Coal Miner — Pikeville, Kentucky**  
 **Grandson of Rosie Walker**

(Beat. The music swell is just a single guitar harmonic and a heartbeat of floor tom.)

**FOOTNOTE CARD (small text):**  
 *Rosie Walker’s known Nashville years: 1962–1972. Final Opry performance: December 31, 1972\. She walked offstage after rewriting a lyric, left a note—“Contract fulfilled. –R”—and was last seen boarding a Greyhound bus at 2 a.m.*

**FOOTNOTE CARD (small text):**  
 *Public records indicate that “Judith Wilson” married Homer Wilson in March 1973 in Pike County; their son David was born that September. Judith never performed publicly again. She died in 2022\.*

**FOOTNOTE CARD (small text):**  
 *Rosie’s catalog remains widely heard. She was an early fighter for artist credit; her label tenure ran 1963–1972.*

---

### **01:25:30 — END CREDITS (over instrumental waltz)**

**CREDITS ROLL.**  
 — “Archival Interviews Courtesy of: Parton Estate, Nelson Archives, Jones Estate” (fictional clearances for this scenario).  
 — “Special Thanks: Pike County Clerk’s Office; Murphy’s Bar, Pikeville.”  
 — “Directed by Nina \_\_\_\_\_\_.”

**FINAL CARD:**  
 *In memory of Judith “Rosie” Walker (1945–2022).*

---

## **APPENDIX — SELECTED SCENE NOTES FOR PRODUCTION**

**Music Supervision Notes**

* Use **instrumental** motifs echoing *Baptized in Bourbon* and *Good Girls Go to Heaven*—no lyrical quotes. Cue the bar performance with an **arrangement‑only clearance** of “Shenandoah Sunrise.” (Rosie catalog references throughout—no full-song lyrics.)

**Cinematography**

* Rosie-era sequences: 16mm grain, hand‑held; Pikeville present day: cold glassy primes; Murphy’s: practical neons, warm sodium backlight; emphasize the **moment the room shifts** when Alex enters.

* Guitar close‑ups: macro on rosette and pick wear to suggest heritage; intercut with Rosie archival stills of **Betty**.

**Interview Targets & Lower‑Thirds**

* **Music Historian** — “Rosie & the Outlaw Pivot.”

* **Session Guitarist** — “The ’59 D‑28 and the ‘Rosie tone’.”

* **Pike County Clerk** — Marriage/birth/death records connecting Judith ↔ Homer ↔ David ↔ Alex.

* **Motel Manager (Darla)** — Local rumor vector to Murphy’s.

* **Neighbors** — Judith’s quiet life; radio triggers.

**Fact Cards**

* Opry pants scandal \+ “shackles” quote context; *Time* “Wild Child” tag (use paraphrase, archival headlines).

* Two \#1 albums; Pop crossover; 147-date tour; kicked from Opry twice; protest song buried; public exec blow‑up.

* Quotes tiles: **Parton** / **Nelson** / **Jones** (archival).

**Ethical Statement (on site)**

* Film ins and outs at Murphy’s with venue consent. Avoid faces of patrons who decline. Do **not** identify Alex until the final reveal card.

* Do not contact Alex pre‑broadcast (per scenario). Post‑broadcast outreach plan to be included in closing card of Episode 2, if commissioned.

**Marketing Hook**

* “For fifty years, all we had were rumors. Then a page surfaced—and a bar fell silent.”

---

**Outcome:** The episode withholds Alex until **71:00**, uses the **journal fragment** as the engine of the search, and ends with the on‑screen reveal: **ALEX WILSON, 22, COAL MINER — GRANDSON OF ROSIE WALKER.** The credits breathe on that chord so the world can feel the floor drop out from under him—and rise.

### **PRESS RELEASE \#1 — PRE-BROADCAST (NO ALEX)**

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
 **Netflix Sets Global Premiere for New Flagship Documentary “Searching for Rosie Walker”**  
 *A never-before-seen journal fragment ignites the 50-year mystery behind country music’s most infamous disappearance*

**LOS GATOS, Calif. — June 10, 2025** — Netflix today announced the global premiere of **Searching for Rosie Walker**, an investigative feature documentary about the rise, revolt, and sudden disappearance of 1960s country megastar **Rosie Walker**. The film launches worldwide **July 4, 2025**.

From award-winning director **Nina \_\_\_\_\_\_** and Little Mountain Films, *Searching for Rosie Walker* traces how a single **torn journal page found at a Kentucky flea market**—independently authenticated by handwriting specialists—became the first credible clue in five decades about a legend who went supernova and vanished at the height of her fame.

**“Rosie Walker was the brightest star of a generation—and then she walked offstage and out of history,”** said **Brandon Riegg**, Vice President, Nonfiction Series & Docs, Netflix. **“This film is a love letter to her music and a rigorous, humane investigation of the mystery she left behind.”**

Blending rare archival footage, newly uncovered documents, and on-the-ground reporting in **Appalachia**, the film revisits Walker’s barrier-breaking run—two \#1 albums, pop crossover success, and headline-making defiance of Nashville’s gatekeepers—before following the paper trail the journal fragment points to. The documentary also examines the business forces around Walker, including a **predatory contract model** of the era that left artists with fame but few rights.

**“We started with one page and a hunch,”** said director **Nina \_\_\_\_\_\_**. **“What we found is a human story about power, vanishing, and the cost of telling the truth too soon.”**

In the film’s final act, after months of on-the-ground reporting sparked by a newly authenticated **1972 journal fragment**, the investigation converges in **Pikeville, Kentucky**, where the documentary identifies **Alex Wilson**, **22**, a coal miner and guitarist, as **Rosie Walker’s grandson**.
