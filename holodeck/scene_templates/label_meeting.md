## Variation Elements

### Industry Person Types

- **Mutual Interest**: Both see potential value
- **Alex Has Heat**: Something viral/hot, they're pursuing him
- **Complex Web**: Multiple interests, politics, competing agendas

### Beauty Impact in Professional Settings
- **Subtle Professional**: Slightly longer meeting, warmer tone, benefit of doubt
- **Obvious Attraction**: Unprofessional interest complicating business
- **Double-Edged**: "Too pretty for country" or "product not artist"
- **Ignored**: Some people immune/professional

### Truth vs Performance
- **Tommy's Script**: Alex tries to follow coaching, struggles
- **Calculated Honesty**: Strategic truth-telling
- **Full Transparency**: Alex can't maintain lie, tells real story

### Meeting Directions

**Positive Movement**:
- They're interested but have concerns

- Introduce to other people

**Negative Movement**:
- Not right fit for them

## Common Follow-up Scenes

1. **Debrief with Tommy**: Processing what happened
2. **Celebration or Commiseration**: Depending on outcome
3. **Research/Decision**: If offer made, figuring out if it's good
4. **Waiting**: Days/weeks for response
5. **Rejection Processing**: What it means for plans
6. **Next Meeting**: If this one went well

## Director Tips

**For High Stakes:**
```
SCENE: Alex meets Sarah Chen from Big Loud at Barista Parlor
FOCUS: on power dynamics and Alex's awareness of opportunity cost
TONE: Tense but grounded, real professional stakes
```

**For Disaster Comedy:**
```
SCENE: Label meeting where Alex absolutely cannot maintain the professional lie
TONE: Chaos comedy but with real consequences
```

**For Character Study:**
```
SCENE: Coffee with indie label owner who actually gets Alex's music
FOCUS: on the temptation of being seen vs need for commercial success
TEMPO: Slow, let conversation breathe
```

**For Complication:**
```
SCENE: Meeting gets interrupted by [X], forcing Alex to make unexpected choice
INTRODUCE: [complicating element]
```

## Critical Remember Points

1. **Industry people aren't villains**: They have pressures, quotas, genuine taste
2. **Alex's class background matters**: Code-switching, vocabulary, assumptions
3. **Beauty impacts differently here**: Can help (memorable) or hurt (not serious)
4. **Tommy's absence/presence changes dynamic**: External brain vs authentic Alex
5. **Money desperation affects choices**: What Alex will/won't accept
6. **One meeting rarely changes everything**: Real industry moves slowly
7. **Honesty is Alex's superpower**: But also his vulnerability
8. **These meetings cost time and money**: Parking, gas, time not working

- What does success look like to him?
- What does success look like to them?
- What's his energy level?
