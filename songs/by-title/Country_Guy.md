## Description
A high-energy country pop anthem, "Country Guy" embodies the spirit of rural freedom and rebellious charm. Driven by a mid-tempo (105 BPM) groove, the song features minimalist acoustic guitar and husky vocals in the verses, evolving into explosive choruses with bold belts, soaring pedal steel, and punchy 'yeehaw' accents. The bridge builds tension through layered vocals and swelling instrumentation before a final, cathartic chorus. The song's energy fades with echoed guitar riffs, pedal steel trails, and distant 'yeehaws,' leaving the listener with a sense of thrilling, untamed liberty.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Whispered vocal over sparse acoustic guitar riff, building to upbeat country pop drums and twangy electric guitar. A sly grin in a dimly lit honky-tonk, with rural swagger)

(Verse 1 - Husky whisper-sung)
White boots stompin' dust on this backroad trail,
Hat brim low, where the good boys fail.
Town lights flicker, but I'm out in the wild,
Chasin' the thrill, runnin' reckless and styled.
They whisper warnings 'bout guys like me,
But I just chuckle, 'cause I'm wild and free.

(Pre-Chorus - Building tension, harmonies fade in)
No turnin' back from this fire I stoke,
Gonna own the night, let the wild oats choke.
Got a heart of gold under this denim blue
Yeah, I’m trouble, honey, but I’m trouble for you.

(Chorus - Explosive, anthemic)
I'm the country guy, yeehaw,
Breakin' hearts slow, stealin' the draw.
Feel the rush, yeehaw,
Truck bed high, takin' command.
Watch me ride, yeehaw,
No holdin' down this dusty soul.
I'm the country guy, yeehaw!

(Verse 2 - Edgy murmur, building to bold delivery)
Truck bed loaded with hay bale lies,
Wind in my flannel, stars in my eyes.
Folks shake their heads at the dust I stir,
But I'm dancin' free, feelin' that spur.
Call it outlaw, say it's a game,
But I tip my Stetson, ownin' the flame.

(Pre-Chorus - Intensifying, fiddle hints)
No fences 'round this spirit I claim,
Gonna claim the trail, playin' my game.
Got a taste for freedom, can't be tied down.
Yeah, I roam these highways all over town.

(Chorus - Explosive, anthemic)
I'm the country guy, yeehaw,
Breakin' hearts slow, stealin' the draw.
Feel the rush, yeehaw,
Truck bed high, takin' command.
Watch me ride, yeehaw,
No holdin' down this dusty soul.
I'm the country guy, yeehaw!

(Bridge - Whispered build to shout, pedal steel rise)
Think you can rope me? Ha, good luck tryin',
I'm the wild mustang, always flyin'.
No sorrow here, just the trail I blaze,
In this country heart, the fire stays.
(Whisper: Yeehaw...)
(Shout: Country Guy!)

(Chorus - Huge, crowd-energizing climax)
I'm the country guy, yeehaw,
Breakin' hearts slow, stealin' the draw.
Feel the rush, yeehaw,
Truck bed high, takin' command.
Watch me ride, yeehaw,
No holdin' down this dusty soul.
I'm the country guy, yeehaw!

(Outro - Fades with whispered echoes, riff repeats, and yeehaws)
Yeehaw, country guy...
Feel the rush...
Yeehaw, lettin' it ride!

## Performance Notes

*Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar, electric guitar (twangy lead), bass, drums, pedal steel, fiddle, backing vocals (harmonies). Consider adding a banjo or mandolin for texture.
*Tempo: Mid-tempo, around 105 BPM. Should feel like a comfortable cruising speed.
*Key: G Major. A bright and common key for country music.
*Vocal Delivery: Verses should be delivered with a husky, almost whispered tone, gradually building in intensity. Choruses should be belted with power and passion. Backing vocals should provide harmonies and support the lead vocal.
*Arrangement: The arrangement should be dynamic, with the verses building to the pre-choruses and then exploding into the choruses. Pay attention to the use of dynamics to create tension and release. The bridge should provide a moment of reflection before the final chorus.
*Production: Aim for a polished but authentic country sound. Use reverb and delay to create space in the mix. Ensure that the pedal steel guitar and fiddle are prominent and add to the overall texture of the song.
*Live Performance: Encourage audience participation during the choruses, particularly the 'yeehaw' accents. Create a sense of community and celebration.
*Consider adding a short guitar solo after the second chorus to showcase the twangy electric guitar sound.
