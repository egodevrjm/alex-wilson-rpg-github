## **53\. Scenario: The Pikeville Convergence \- The Ghost and the Machine (Age 22\)**

**Setup:** It's early February 2025\. In Pikeville, Kentucky, Alex Wilson and Tommy Crawford are working their shift deep in the Cochran Mine, nursing hangovers. Alex, a local musician known for his raw talent and a magnetic presence that seems to bend rooms in his direction, is completely unaware of his family's history.

Simultaneously, a Netflix documentary crew arrives in Pikeville. They are chasing their only lead in a 50-year-old mystery: a fragment from a journal belonging to vanished country music legend Rosie Walker, which gives them a place and a name. They are hunting for a ghost, with no idea their ghost has a grandson.

**Canon Context:** This scenario assumes the core canon: Judith Wilson (MawMaw) was secretly Rosie Walker. She fled Nashville in 1972 while two months pregnant with David. Alex knows nothing of this; to him, MawMaw was just a kind, non-musical woman who gave him her old **1959 Martin D-28 ("Betty")** and raised him when his own father proved unfit.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**Key Factions & Characters:**

* **Alex & Tommy:** Best friends, bonded by the coal mine.  
* **The Netflix Crew (On-Site):**  
  * **\[Director name\]:** The driven, meticulous director, focused on the historical paper trail.  
  * **\[Cinematographer name\]:** The veteran cinematographer with an eye for unscripted beauty.  
* **The Netflix Crew (Remote):** A team of researchers, producers, and experts connected via a hyperactive Slack channel (`#finding-rosie`), providing real-time data from Los Angeles.

**The Investigation Arc (The Slow Burn):**

1. **The Lead:** The crew's only starting point is a journal fragment: `"...Stop running, stop running. But I can't go back. Not now. Not with the baby coming. Judith will be my name now. A good, quiet name..."` Their mission is to find a "Judith" who appeared in Pikeville in late 1972 or early 1973\.  
2. **First Human Intel:** The `[Motel Manager]` will point them toward Murphy's Bar as a good spot to film "local color" and hear some authentic Appalachian music. Alex is not mentioned specifically.  
3. **The First Sighting:** While filming B-roll at Murphy's, they are immediately drawn to Alex before he even plays a note. His sheer physical presence and the way the room subtly reorients around him make him a compelling subject for the `[Cinematographer]`.  
4. **The "Holy Shit" Moment:** Alex plays his set, likely his own upbeat songs. The *real* discovery happens when the remote team, reviewing the footage, has a vintage guitar expert on the Slack channel identify the instrument he's playing. A frantic message appears: `HOLY SHIT. THAT'S BETTY. THAT'S ROSIE WALKER'S 1959 MARTIN. I'D STAKE MY CAREER ON IT.`  
5. **Connecting the Dots:** The focus shifts entirely. "The handsome kid with the guitar" is now their primary lead. The name "Wilson" becomes critical, and the remote team frantically cross-references it with their search for "Judith," quickly uncovering the marriage and birth records.  
6. **The Final Proof:** The investigation will culminate in irrefutable evidence, likely DNA from a discarded PBR bottle Alex drank from at Murphy's, confirming he is Rosie Walker's grandson.

**Narrative Tone & Style Reminders:**

* **Voice:** Write as the "folksy historian," with a warm, conversational, and specific style.  
* **Pacing:** This is a slow burn. The two worlds operate in parallel before they collide.  
* **Character:** Emphasize Alex's casual, un-cocky awareness of his own magnetism.

### **Opening Scene: The Cage and The Van**

**Date:** Tuesday, February 4th, 2025, 6:15 AM **Location:** Split between the Cochran Mine \#4 cage and a Netflix rental van on US-23.

The cage groans, a tired metal beast descending into the earth's guts. It’s cold, damp, and smells of wet rock, machine grease, and the stale Pabst Blue Ribbon sweating from Alex’s pores. He leans his head against the rattling chain-link wall, eyes closed, the single bare bulb above painting harsh shadows across the planes of his face.

Tommy stands opposite, looking only marginally better. He takes a long pull from a dented thermos. "Remind me again," he says, his voice a low rasp. "Whose idea was it to try and teach that basset hound at the bar to sing 'Jolene' at two in the morning?"

Alex cracks a half-smile without opening his eyes. "Pretty sure that was yours. My idea was seeing if we could pay for our tab with that song I wrote about the Dollar General cashier."

"Right," Tommy grunts. "Because that worked out so well the first time." The cage shudders to a halt at the bottom, the clang echoing down the dark tunnel. "Another day in paradise."

---

The Netflix van smells of fresh upholstery, lukewarm coffee, and the low, anxious hum of expensive electronics. Snowflakes melt on the windshield as the van winds its way down US-23, the mountains of Pike County looming grey and immense on either side.

The `[Director]` stares at her laptop, where a high-resolution image of the journal fragment is pinned in the `#finding-rosie` Slack channel: `"...Stop running, stop running. But I can't go back. Not now. Not with the baby coming. Judith will be my name now. A good, quiet name..."`

A new message pops up from a `[Producer]` in L.A.

`[Producer]_LA: Morning team. Any hits on "Judith" in the county pre-searches yet? Execs are hungry for a tangible next step now that you're on the ground.`

The `[Director]` types back, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

`[Director]: Negative. Digital records from that era are a ghost town. We hit the county clerk's office as soon as they open. The paper trail starts today.`

The `[Cinematographer]` lowers his camera from where he'd been capturing the fog-choked hollers. "You really think we're going to find her from a single first name?"

"She was a person," the `[Director]` says, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. "People leave tracks. Marriages, births, deaths. She's here somewhere. We just have to dig."

The van takes the exit for Pikeville. In the pre-dawn gloom, the first building they see is a squat, cinder-block motel with a flickering neon sign. The sign reads: `The Hillbilly Inn. Vacancy.`

**\[The two worlds are now in the same ten-mile radius. What happens next?\]**
