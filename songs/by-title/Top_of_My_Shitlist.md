## Description
A high-energy, tongue-in-cheek pop-country anthem about settling scores the Kentucky way. "Top of My Shitlist" blends punchy acoustic rhythms with a twangy banjo, stomping drums, and soaring fiddle lines. Alex Wilson's snarky baritone leads the charge, backed by rowdy gang vocals and playful instrumentation. The song builds from simmering verses to explosive choruses, punctuated by a taunting bridge and a raucous barroom outro. It’s a celebration of small-town grudges and backwoods justice, delivered with a wink and a whole lot of attitude.

## Lyrics

(Intro - Upbeat acoustic riff with a snarky banjo twang, building to a stomping drum beat, like a Kentucky bar fight brewing)

(Verse 1)
You know who you are, with that slick, slimy grin,
Swipin’ my bourbon, blamin’ it on kin.
Fenced my huntin’ ground, called it your own dirt,
Sold my mower for a twenty, left my pride in the hurt.
Struttin’ ‘round the county like you own every street,
But you’re just a loudmouth fool, and I’m callin’ your beat.

(Pre-Chorus)
Slicker than a mudslide, dumber than a post,
Got me dreamin’ ‘bout a shovel and a hauntin’ ghost.

(Chorus - Catchy, dark-humored hook with gang vocals and fiddle kicks)
You’re top of my shitlist, yeah, you know who you are,
If trouble was a trophy, you’d be the shinin’ star.
I’d rather wrestle hogs in a holler full of fleas,
Than deal with your nonsense, you low-down tease.
Top of my shitlist, sittin’ high on that throne,
You’re the burr in my boot, the ache in my bones.
No name’s worth namin’, better watch your back,
You’re top of my shitlist, that’s a Kentucky fact!

(Verse 2)
You “borrowed” my hound, said he ran off to roam,
Found him chewin’ scraps by your raggedy home.
Told the town I can’t handle my moonshine brew,
But I saw you in the ditch, heavin’ after two.
Your big talk’s cheaper than a dollar store can,
This whole damn holler’s done with your scam.

(Pre-Chorus)
Smoother than a possum sneakin’ through the trash,
But I’m loadin’ my comeback, and it’s gonna crash.

(Chorus - Rowdier, with crowd-ready chants)
You’re top of my shitlist, yeah, you know who you are,
If trouble was a trophy, you’d be the shinin’ star.
I’d rather wrestle hogs in a holler full of fleas,
Than deal with your nonsense, you low-down tease.
Top of my shitlist, sittin’ high on that throne,
You’re the burr in my boot, the ache in my bones.
No name’s worth namin’, better watch your back,
You’re top of my shitlist, that’s a Kentucky fact!

(Bridge - Music pulls back to banjo and stomps, then surges)
If I had a nickel for every lie you spun,
I’d buy this county, leave you burned in the sun.
You’re a buzzard in boots, pickin’ at my peace,
This song’s my reckonin’, my sweet release!
Been stealin' my women, be lyin' to friends,
Guess its finally time this story ends!

(Chorus - Massive, barroom brawl finale with whoops and hollers)
You’re top of my shitlist, yeah, you know who you are,
If trouble was a trophy, you’d be the shinin’ star.
I’d rather wrestle hogs in a holler full of fleas,
Than deal with your nonsense, you low-down tease.
Top of my shitlist, sittin’ high on that throne,
You’re the burr in my boot, the ache in my bones.
No name’s worth namin’, better watch your back,
You’re top of my shitlist, that’s a Kentucky fact!

(Outro - Fades with banjo riff, snarky laugh, and barroom clatter)
Top of my shitlist… you know who you are!
Kentucky’s done with you… adios, subpar!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (rhythm and lead fills), banjo (prominent melodic lines and fills), drums (stomping, driving beat), bass guitar (supportive, walking basslines in some sections), fiddle (soaring melodies and countermelodies), pedal steel (adds country flavor and fills), gang vocals (in chorus and bridge), harmonica (optional, for bluesy flavor). 
Tempo: Up-tempo, driving feel. Aim for a slightly frantic energy to enhance the comedic tension.
Key: G Major works well for this style and instrumentation. 
Bridge Vocal Style: Call-and-response should be delivered with increasing intensity, building to the final chorus.
Outro: Gradually fade out the instruments, ending with the banjo riff and barroom sounds.
