## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Gotta truck loaded down with everything I own
Mama's crying on the porch, says I should stay home
But there's a fire in my chest that won't let me be
Gonna chase that neon dream or die trying, you see
Gotta guitar and my pride, that's all I need tonight
Heading down that interstate toward the city lights

[Chorus]
Win or lose, we ride
Till the wheels fall off this dream
Win or lose, we ride
Ain't as crazy as it seems
When your back's against the wall
And you're betting it all
Win or lose, we ride
Win or lose, we ride

[Verse 2]
Called my buddy Jake, said "Boy, you coming too?"
He said "Hell yeah, man, ain't got nothing left to lose"
We been talking 'bout this since we were seventeen
Playing cover songs and living someone else's dream
Now the highway's calling and we're answering back
Two small-town boys on a one-way track

[Chorus]
Win or lose, we ride
Till the wheels fall off this dream
Win or lose, we ride
Ain't as crazy as it seems
When your back's against the wall
And you're betting it all
Win or lose, we ride
Win or lose, we ride

[Bridge]
Might end up broke and broken-hearted
Might be right back where we started
But we'll never have to wonder "what if"
When we're old and gray and stiff

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Win or lose, we ride
Till the wheels fall off this dream
Win or lose, we ride
Ain't as crazy as it seems
When your back's against the wall
And you're betting it all
Win or lose, we ride
Win or lose, we ride

[Outro]
Yeah, win or lose, we ride
Win or lose, we ride (Fade out)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard country rock band setup - electric guitars (one with a slight overdrive, one clean rhythm), acoustic guitar (for added texture), bass guitar (driving, with a slight walking bass line during the verses), drums (straight-ahead rock beat with a little country swing), and potentially a keyboard or organ for subtle backing. Consider adding a harmonica for a touch of grit. The guitar solo should be energetic and blues-influenced, showcasing Alex's skill.

Tempo: Upbeat and driving, perfect for head-nodding and air-guitar solos.

Key: E major would be a strong key choice for a bright, energetic feel, also a comfortable key for a guitar-driven song and for male vocals.

Structure: The song benefits from a well-defined structure. Consider adding a pre-chorus to build anticipation. A guitar solo after the bridge provides a dynamic break before the final chorus.

Vocal Delivery: Alex should deliver the lyrics with conviction and passion, capturing the raw emotion and determination of the song's message. Think Springsteen or Mellencamp influence.

Overall Feel: High-energy, anthemic, and relatable. This is a song that should inspire listeners to chase their dreams, no matter the odds.
