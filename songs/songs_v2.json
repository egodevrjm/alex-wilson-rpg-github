The gang vocals should be enthusiastic and slightly out of tune, adding to the sense of a spontaneous celebration. The solos should be short and fiery, showcasing the virtuosity of the musicians without losing the overall momentum of the song. The mix should be balanced but slightly unpolished, capturing the imperfections and quirks of a live recording. The train-strum acoustic guitar style should be prominent, maintaining the constant forward motion of the song. The banjo should complement the guitar, adding intricate melodic flourishes and rhythmic complexity.\nThe harmonica should have a slightly dirty, bluesy tone. Use a dynamic microphone for the vocals to capture the nuances of the performance.\nConsider using a slapback delay on the vocals to enhance the vintage feel.\nThe upright bass should be miked with both a microphone and a pickup to capture both the acoustic and electric aspects of the instrument.","image_url":"https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/zebra/PtHrYsta0Gf3EerhyUfSP.jpg","audio_url":"","created_at":"2025-09-26T21:45:20.95+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-26T21:45:38.15707+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A high-octane bluegrass-infused country romp that celebrates reckless abandon and small-town legend-making. \"Jump the Gorge\" tells the story of a daredevil and their trusty, beat-up Ford truck named Betty, attempting an impossible jump over a local gorge.

The instrumental break after the bridge offers a chance for the Telecaster and Fiddle to trade licks. Add a slight build in intensity leading into the final chorus with heavier handclaps and tambourine. The Steel guitar should be mixed low in the verses and pre-chorus but brought forward in the chorus to provide a lush harmonic bed.","image_url":"https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/rabbit/GXff9LYU1-4wXFG_-rWmZ.jpg","audio_url":"","created_at":"2025-09-26T21:40:53.231+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-26T21:41:10.078868+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A rowdy, heartwarming barroom two-step celebrating life's milestones and everyday joys.

Vocals should have a slightly raspy, lived-in quality. Harmonies in the chorus should be raw and slightly out-of-tune for a 'gang' feel. Tempo: Moderate, but with a slight drag to emphasize the weariness in the lyrics. Dynamic range: Build from a quiet verse to a louder, more energetic chorus. The fiddle should be played with a vibrato-rich, slightly mournful tone. The slide guitar should have a slightly distorted, gritty sound. The acoustic guitar can be a Martin D-28, Gibson J-45, or similar dreadnought.","image_url":"https://v3b.fal.media/files/b/koala/DYjSegfICLCsufu8lo0L_.jpg","audio_url":"","created_at":"2025-09-26T21:35:34.715+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-26T21:35:50.823283+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A mid-tempo, outlaw-tinged Americana track with a gritty, foot-stomping shuffle beat.

Tempo: 96 BPM. The song's foundation lies in its contrast between intimacy and grandeur. Focus on creating a wide stereo image, especially during the choruses, using layered synths and vocal chops. The 808 sub bass should be felt more than heard, providing a subtle low-end rumble. Guitar parts should be meticulously crafted with attention to reverb and delay, aiming for a shimmering, ethereal quality. The steel/slide guitar, treated with shimmer reverb, adds a unique sonic texture reminiscent of ambient pop rather than traditional country. Vocals should be delivered with a sense of vulnerability and acceptance. In the bridge, consider a slight increase in vocal intensity and a more prominent acoustic guitar strum for added emotional impact. The final chorus should explode with energy, driven by doubletime hi-hat patterns and wide stereo synth swells. Pay attention to dynamic contrast throughout the song, building gradually towards the climactic final chorus. Consider adding subtle autotune or formant shifting to the vocal chops to create a more robotic, futuristic sound.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/rabbit/a8cSH3-SMauTr8s_wObFT.jpeg","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/GravityWins-1754811994673.mp3","created_at":"2025-08-10T07:15:40.645+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-27T09:33:08.709431+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A cinematic country pop ballad begins with delicate acoustic guitar and airy pads, then welcomes rich, echoing electric guitars and gentle synth swells.

Consider using a gated reverb on the snare for a more pronounced 80s-inspired feel.\n*   **Bass:** A tight, syncopated bassline is crucial, emphasizing the 'funk' aspect. Consider a slap bass section in the bridge or pre-chorus for added energy.\n*   **Guitar:** Clean electric guitar chops on the upbeat, with occasional wah or envelope filter for added funk flavor. A short, melodic guitar solo can follow the second chorus, building into the bridge.\n*   **Horns:** Staccato horn stabs are key for energy; think Tower of Power or early Maroon 5. Layered trumpets, trombones, and saxophones will add depth.\n*   **Keys:** Minimal keys in the verses, focusing on Rhodes piano or a simple organ comp. Choruses feature big synth pads (Sawtooth or Juno-style) to fill out the soundscape.\n*   **Vocals:** Charismatic and playful vocal delivery. Encourage conversational phrasing in verses, with a belted/falsetto mix in the hook for pop punch. Harmonies should be stacked and tight in the choruses.\n*   **Production:** Focus on a clean, modern sound with strong stereo imaging. Ensure the bass is tight and punchy, and the drums have plenty of presence. The vocal should be front and center, but not overpowering the instrumentation.\n*   **Tempo:** Maintain a consistent tempo of 110 BPM. A slight push in tempo leading into the choruses could add excitement.\n*   **Arrangement:** The song benefits from dynamic variation. The verses are stripped down, building gradually to the pre-chorus. The bridge provides a contrast before a massive final chorus.\n","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/monkey/xPTI7vTsnmDzQK_3BhVtS.jpeg","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/PunchtheClock-1754812089790.mp3","created_at":"2025-08-10T07:13:07.282+00:00","updated_at":"2025-08-13T13:48:25.82+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A high-energy funk-pop anthem about escaping the daily grind. \"Punch the Clock\" features a charismatic Kentucky baritone voice over a tight, syncopated groove.

The song explores themes of strained father-son relationships, the weight of unspoken words, and the challenging path to understanding and releasing past hurts.","bpm":"68","key":"G"},{"id":"83ae440b-db26-4ad3-938f-20feffed390a","title":"Normal's Just Another Cage","artist":"Alex Wilson","album":"Dirt Road Testament","genre":"Country/Country Rock/Southern Rock/Rock","year":2025,"duration":"3:35","lyrics":"Verse 1:\nClocked out at five, same as every day\nBoss man's talkin' 'bout that overtime pay\nBut I got plans that he don't understand\nGot my truck, got my girl, got a cold beer in my hand\nRadio's crankin', windows rolled down low\nLeavin' all that nine-to-five behind, you know\n\nChorus:\nNormal's just another cage\nAin't gonna live life on their stage\nTailgate down, Friday night\nBlue jeans on and I feel alright\nNormal's just another cage\nI'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page\nTailgate down, Friday night\nThis is how I come alive\n\nVerse 2:\nThey say settle down, buy a house with a fence\nWork forty years, hope it all makes sense\nBut I'd rather be wild than safely contained\nLife's too short to be living afraid\nGot that fire in my soul, burnin' bright and free\nGonna chase the setting sun for all eternity\n\nChorus:\nNormal's just another cage\nAin't gonna live life on their stage\nTailgate down, Friday night\nBlue jeans on and I feel alright\nNormal's just another cage\nI'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page\nTailgate down, Friday night\nThis is how I come alive\n\nBridge:\nSo let 'em talk about their perfect plans\nI'll take my chances right here where I stand\nFreedom's callin' out my name so loud\nI won't be locked up in their puppet crowd\nDirt road dust and a fiery sunset sky\nThat's where I feel like I can spread my wings and fly\n\nChorus:\nNormal's just another cage\nAin't gonna live life on their stage\nTailgate down, Friday night\nBlue jeans on and I feel alright\nNormal's just another cage\nI'm breakin' out, I'm turnin' the page\nTailgate down, Friday night\nThis is how I come alive\nThis is how I come alive\n\nOutro:\nYeah, this is how I come alive (Guitar riff fades)\nFriday night freedom, under these starry skies!\n","notes":"Tempo: Upbeat and driving, around 110 bpm. Aim for a steady, powerful feel.\nInstrumentation: The song should open with a strong, slightly overdriven acoustic guitar riff. Drums enter powerfully with a driving backbeat. Electric guitars should be prominent, adding both rhythm and lead elements. The bass line should be locked in with the drums, creating a solid foundation. Use pedal steel guitar sparingly for texture, emotional swells, and fills, particularly in the bridge and instrumental break. Consider adding a Hammond organ swell underneath the chorus for added depth.\nVocals: Alex's vocals need to be raw and authentic, conveying both the frustration of being trapped and the exhilaration of freedom. Emphasize the grit and passion in his delivery.\nHarmonies: Add simple but effective harmonies in the chorus, particularly on the higher notes, to create a fuller, anthemic sound. Use a call-and-response harmony on \"Normal's just another cage\".\nPerformance: Encourage crowd participation during the chorus, especially on the \"Normal's just another cage\" line. Get the audience clapping along to the beat during the verses. The song should build in energy throughout. The bridge should be dynamic, starting quieter and building to a powerful release back into the final chorus. Feature a guitar solo after the second chorus – a bluesy, melodic solo that complements the song's theme of freedom. \nStructure: Add an instrumental break after the second chorus: four bars of guitar solo over the verse chords. The outro should fade out slowly with the guitar riff and ad-libs from Alex. Live, Alex can ad-lib over the outro: \"Alright! Let's hear it!\" or something similar to increase the energy. The song's raw energy makes it a perfect set opener or closer. Consider adding a slight delay effect to Alex's vocals on the outro.\nKey: The key of G is well-suited to country-rock vocals and guitars.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/lion/WOmO2NVBTFa596h1FxbEI.jpeg","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/NormalsJustAnotherCage-1754140090315.mp3","created_at":"2025-08-02T13:02:05.033+00:00","updated_at":"2025-08-13T13:49:52.967+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"\"Normal's Just Another Cage\" is Alex Wilson's rebellious call to arms for anyone feeling stifled by the daily grind.

The song would benefit from some slide guitar riffs in Em pentatonic.\n\nVocals: Alex Wilson's delivery should be raw and emotionally charged, emphasizing the pain and anger in the lyrics. Backing vocals could be added in the chorus for emphasis, with harmonies that are slightly dissonant to create a sense of unease.\n\nArrangement: The song should build in intensity throughout, starting with a simple arrangement in the verses and gradually adding more instruments in the choruses and bridge. The final chorus and outro should be the most powerful and emotionally resonant parts of the song.

It's a modern take on classic country themes of hard work, gratitude, and the importance of finding happiness in the everyday.","bpm":"120","key":"G"},{"id":"d86ee9e3-9d9f-45ce-a433-e7d5477efeec","title":"Pocket Full of Sunshine","artist":"Alex Wilson","album":"Sunrise Serenade","genre":"Pop Country/Country Pop/Pop/Contemporary Country","year":2025,"duration":"3:35","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nWoke up late but who’s keepin' score\nToast burned black but I want some more\nGot a hole in my shoe but it feels just fine\nThe sun’s still shining and the day is mine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTraffic’s jammed but I hum a tune\nClouds roll in but they’ll roll out soon\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a pocketful of sunshine\nA little bit of laughter and a bottle of time\nYou can throw the rain but I’ll still shine\nWith my pocketful of sunshine\n\n[Verse 2]\nPhone’s dead flat but the world’s alive\nGot no map but I know I’ll drive\nThrough dirt roads where the daisies grow\nA little dust on my boots and a smile to show\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe world spins wild but I hold on tight\nEvery wrong turn still feels so right\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a pocketful of sunshine\nA little bit of laughter and a bottle of time\nYou can throw the rain but I’ll still shine\nWith my pocketful of sunshine\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, life ain’t perfect, got its ups and downs\nBut I’m gonna wear my smile all over town\nLet the worries fade, let the good times roll\nSunshine in my heart, sunshine in my soul\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n(Instrumental Break - approx 8 bars)\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a pocketful of sunshine\nA little bit of laughter and a bottle of time\nYou can throw the rain but I’ll still shine\nWith my pocketful of sunshine\n\n[Outro]\nPocketful of sunshine, yeah\nPocketful of sunshine\nI'll still shine, I'll still shine\nWith my pocketful of sunshine\nOh-oh-oh, I'll still shine\nWith my pocketful of sunshine","notes":"Instrumentation: Drums (driving but not overly complex, focus on a steady kick and snare groove with subtle hi-hat variations), electric guitars (twangy Telecaster rhythm with a clean tone, and a slightly overdriven lead guitar for fills and solos), acoustic guitar (steel-string for added texture, strummed chords and fingerpicked arpeggios), bass guitar (provides a solid groove, walking bass lines during the pre-chorus), fiddle (plays melodic lines and fills between vocal phrases, short solos over the pre-chorus), handclaps (on beats 2 and 4 in the chorus and verses, slightly delayed for a 'live' feel), subtle world percussion (shakers, tambourine, djembe) to add depth and a subtle backbeat. The song builds dynamically, with the bridge providing a moment of reflection (consider a slightly softer dynamic and a key change up a half step) before returning to the final chorus. The fiddle solos can be improvised or written out in a bluegrass-tinged style. Guitar solo should be melodic and blues-influenced, keeping within the key of G major.

Stack vocal harmonies in the chorus, starting with a simple two-part harmony and building to a fuller three-part arrangement in the final chorus. The outro should feature a gentle acoustic guitar fade-out, with the final line spoken with a hint of wistfulness.\n\nTempo: Keep the tempo relaxed and unhurried. The goal is to create a feeling of quiet reflection.\n\nKey: The song is well-suited for a major key (G major works well) as it reinforces the positive and optimistic theme.\n\nPerformance Notes: The lead vocal should be delivered with a conversational, slightly raspy tone. Emphasize the storytelling aspect of the lyrics. The harmonies should be tight and blend well with the lead vocal. The instrumentalists should listen to each other carefully and create a cohesive soundscape. The bridge should be performed with a slight increase in intensity, building anticipation for the final chorus. The final chorus should be the most dynamic part of the song, with all instruments and vocals reaching their peak. Pay close attention to dynamics throughout the song to create a sense of ebb and flow. Consider adding a subtle delay effect to the steel guitar and lead vocal to enhance the dreamy atmosphere.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/rabbit/cnhRAL-5rbwMOwQyhWohR.jpeg","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/StillGottheSmile-1753629068102.mp3","created_at":"2025-07-27T15:09:03.422+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-27T15:11:12.783887+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A mid-tempo country-pop anthem of resilience and quiet optimism. \"Still Got the Smile\" blends the twang of acoustic rhythm guitar and subtle banjo with the ethereal shimmer of steel guitar swells, all grounded by a contemporary snap-pop drum loop.

The banjo should be prominent but not overwhelming, providing rhythmic drive and fills. Fiddle flourishes add to the country feel. The bridge section offers an opportunity for a brief instrumental breakdown featuring a call-and-response between the banjo and fiddle. The outro should build slightly, ending with a final engine rev and a fading echo of the 'oh oh's'. Consider adding a 'holler' or two for extra energy in the live performance.

Should feel steady and driving, but not rushed.\nKey: G Major. Lends itself to the open chords and bright sound.\nArrangement: Intro builds gradually. Verse 1 features mostly acoustic instruments. The pre-chorus adds more drive from the bass and drums. The chorus is full band, with harmonies on the vocals. The bridge strips back the instrumentation to create a moment of reflection. The instrumental break allows each instrument to shine.\nMixing: Focus on a clean and balanced mix. The vocals should be clear and upfront. The fiddle, pedal steel, and Telecaster should have distinct spaces in the mix. The drums should provide a solid foundation without overpowering the other instruments. Consider adding subtle reverb to create a sense of space, especially on the pedal steel and fiddle.\nPerformance Notes: The vocalist should convey sincerity and heartfelt emotion. The fiddle and pedal steel players should be expressive and soulful. The drummer should maintain a steady and consistent groove. The guitar player should use tasteful licks and fills that complement the melody. Pay attention to dynamics and build throughout the song. The chorus should be the most powerful and impactful section.\nConsider adding a backing vocal harmony on the final chorus for added depth and grandeur.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/elephant/srr4qd2TOQ5oPGTJCQfNa.png","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/UnderGodandCountyLights-1751639193646.mp3","created_at":"2025-07-04T14:26:28.201+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-04T14:26:47.671047+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A heartfelt country anthem celebrating the enduring spirit of small-town America, 'Under God and County Lights' evokes the nostalgia of Friday night football games, community pride, and the values instilled under the watchful gaze of both faith and tradition.

Build intensity throughout the song, especially in the choruses. The pre-chorus should act as a dynamic lift into the chorus. Utilize gang vocals or layered harmonies in the choruses to create a larger-than-life sound. \nGuitar Solo: Should be melodic and energetic, utilizing bends and feel-good energy without being overly complex. Focus on creating a memorable hook. \nBridge: Reduce instrumentation significantly during the bridge to create a moment of intimacy before building back up to the final chorus. Consider hand claps and a tambourine to maintain energy while creating a stark contrast. \nOutro: Let the music carry on with the main riff as the vocalist ad-libs and interacts with the 'crowd.'\nKey Suggestion: Use a key that suits Alex Wilson's vocal range; typically D, G or A are great for country vocals.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/panda/7ezBKhCvXvlH6-Nf-Elej.png","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/SmallTownFamous-1751614958466.mp3","created_at":"2025-07-03T08:08:27.391+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-04T07:42:42.373+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A high-energy, anthemic pop-country track celebrating small-town life and local celebrity.

Backing vocals provide harmonies in the chorus and pre-chorus, enriching the melodic texture. Banjo or mandolin licks in the pre-chorus can further emphasize the country element. Pedal steel guitar provides subtle fills and textures, especially during the bridge, adding depth and emotional resonance.\n\nTempo: Maintain the upbeat and energetic tempo at 128 BPM for danceability. A slight increase of 2-4 BPM for the final chorus could further enhance the energy.\n\nKey: E Major is perfect for its bright and accessible feel. Consider briefly modulating to the relative minor (C#m) in the bridge for a touch of melancholy before returning to E Major for the final chorus.\n\nVocal Delivery: The lead vocal should be sassy and confident, tinged with playful sarcasm and vulnerability, particularly in the bridge. Emphasize the emotional rollercoaster through dynamic vocal delivery, increasing intensity in the choruses and softening in the bridge.\n\nProduction: Aim for a clean, radio-friendly sound. The vocals and guitar should be prominent in the mix. Drums should be tight and punchy, providing a solid rhythmic foundation. Strip down the bridge slightly to create dynamic contrast before the final chorus. A gradual fade-out in the outro leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nArrangement suggestions: A key change up a half-step for the final chorus to F major can boost energy significantly. The guitar solo should balance technical skill with melodic sensibility, capturing the song's playful and slightly heartbroken mood. Pay attention to the dynamics between sections to create a compelling and engaging listening experience. Consider adding a brief instrumental tag (a few bars) after the final chorus before the outro to extend the song's impact.","image_url":"https://v3.fal.media/files/penguin/vkG1OAWv-I7Itot9KdG1P.png","audio_url":"https://mxlidlmuqqztsxikjnpe.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/song-audio/8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5/ThoseNewJeans-1751639104373.mp3","created_at":"2025-07-03T07:59:49.359+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-04T14:25:33.470001+00:00","user_id":"8471cf64-36eb-4f5a-9b4c-7a04342118f5","description":"A bittersweet country-pop anthem about running into an ex at the annual county fair and realizing the healing process isn't quite complete.
