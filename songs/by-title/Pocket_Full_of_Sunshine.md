## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Woke up late but who’s keepin' score
Toast burned black but I want some more
Got a hole in my shoe but it feels just fine
The sun’s still shining and the day is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Traffic’s jammed but I hum a tune
Clouds roll in but they’ll roll out soon

[Chorus]
I got a pocketful of sunshine
A little bit of laughter and a bottle of time
You can throw the rain but I’ll still shine
With my pocketful of sunshine

[Verse 2]
Phone’s dead flat but the world’s alive
Got no map but I know I’ll drive
Through dirt roads where the daisies grow
A little dust on my boots and a smile to show

[Pre-Chorus]
The world spins wild but I hold on tight
Every wrong turn still feels so right

[Chorus]
I got a pocketful of sunshine
A little bit of laughter and a bottle of time
You can throw the rain but I’ll still shine
With my pocketful of sunshine

[Bridge]
Yeah, life ain’t perfect, got its ups and downs
But I’m gonna wear my smile all over town
Let the worries fade, let the good times roll
Sunshine in my heart, sunshine in my soul

[Guitar Solo]
(Instrumental Break - approx 8 bars)

[Chorus]
I got a pocketful of sunshine
A little bit of laughter and a bottle of time
You can throw the rain but I’ll still shine
With my pocketful of sunshine

[Outro]
Pocketful of sunshine, yeah
Pocketful of sunshine
I'll still shine, I'll still shine
With my pocketful of sunshine
Oh-oh-oh, I'll still shine
With my pocketful of sunshine

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Drums (driving but not overly complex, focus on a steady kick and snare groove with subtle hi-hat variations), electric guitars (twangy Telecaster rhythm with a clean tone, and a slightly overdriven lead guitar for fills and solos), acoustic guitar (steel-string for added texture, strummed chords and fingerpicked arpeggios), bass guitar (provides a solid groove, walking bass lines during the pre-chorus), fiddle (plays melodic lines and fills between vocal phrases, short solos over the pre-chorus), handclaps (on beats 2 and 4 in the chorus and verses, slightly delayed for a 'live' feel), subtle world percussion (shakers, tambourine, djembe) to add depth and a subtle backbeat. The song builds dynamically, with the bridge providing a moment of reflection (consider a slightly softer dynamic and a key change up a half step) before returning to the final chorus. The fiddle solos can be improvised or written out in a bluegrass-tinged style. Guitar solo should be melodic and blues-influenced, keeping within the key of G major. Vocal harmonies in the chorus (especially thirds and fifths above the melody) would enhance the pop appeal. 

Key: G Major. 
Tempo: Upbeat and energetic, feel good song, BPM around 128-132. 
Vibe: Optimistic, cheerful, feel-good, empowering. 

Consider adding a tag at the end of the outro, repeating the phrase 'Pocketful of Sunshine' a few times with increasing energy before a final sustained chord.
