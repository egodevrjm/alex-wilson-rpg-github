## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Like a phone that's never rung before,
I was quiet, never askin' for more.
A rusted gate, swingin' alone,
Always makin' it on my own.
But tonight, there's somethin' new,
Somethin' warm, somethin' true.
Never knew what it felt to be seen,
Till someone stopped to check on me.

(Pre-Chorus)
And it hits like the first rays after a storm,
Knowin' someone's waitin', safe and warm.

(Chorus)
I'm grateful for somebody caring,
For noticing when I'm not there.
A candle flicker in my darkest night,
Someone who makes wrong things feel right.
No diamonds needed, no gold to spare,
Just someone real, who's always there.
Grateful for somebody caring,
Answerin' calls from a heart that's wearin'.

(Verse 2)
I've learned to breathe on borrowed air,
Never thought I'd find repair.
Now there's bread on the table, warm and good,
Simple kindness understood.
My walls were high, stone by stone,
But tonight, I'm not alone.
Hands that hold, eyes that see,
Found somethin' rare lookin' back at me.

(Pre-Chorus)
Feels like home in a foreign land,
A quiet voice sayin', 'here I am.'

(Chorus)
I'm grateful for somebody caring,
For noticing when I'm not there.
A candle flicker in my darkest night,
Someone who makes wrong things feel right.
No diamonds needed, no gold to spare,
Just someone real, who's always there.
Grateful for somebody caring,
Answerin' calls from a heart that's wearin'.

(Bridge)
They say you don't choose family, but tonight I'm thinkin' twice,
Cause a little love goes a long way, enough to change a life.
Like a desert flower, finding rain,
Washin' away all of the pain.

(Chorus)
I'm grateful for somebody caring,
For noticing when I'm not there.
A candle flicker in my darkest night,
Someone who makes wrong things feel right.
No diamonds needed, no gold to spare,
Just someone real, who's always there.
Grateful for somebody caring,
Answerin' calls from a heart that's wearin'.

(Outro)
Just someone who answers,
Someone who sees,
Someone who's caring,
Someone who believes.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (prominent rhythmic strumming), piano (bright, melodic fills and chord voicings), bass (supportive root notes and walking lines), drums/percussion (driving but not overpowering, favoring kick, snare, and hi-hat with occasional light cymbal crashes), optional: Pedal steel guitar (subtle accents during verses and bridge). Tempo: Medium-upbeat, creating a sense of forward momentum. Vocals: Lead vocals should convey sincerity and warmth, with harmonies in the choruses adding depth and impact. Arrangement: The song builds dynamically, with verses being more intimate and choruses being more expansive. The bridge provides a moment of reflection before leading back into the final chorus. Consider a key change up a half-step or whole step before the final chorus to heighten the emotional impact. The outro should gradually fade out, leaving the listener with a feeling of contentment and hope. Production: Aim for a clean, modern pop sound with a touch of organic warmth from the acoustic instruments. Reverb and delay should be used tastefully to enhance the vocal and instrumental textures.
