## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Found a cracked guitar in a neighbor's trash,
Strings like barbed wire, bent neck, no cash.
Snuck it home under a coat too thin,
Waited 'til Daddy passed out again.
Notes were lifelines, chords were prayers,
A voice in the silence nobody dared.
No spotlight dream or neon crown—
I sang so I wouldn’t drown.

[Chorus]
I didn’t sing to be famous, didn’t chase no gold,
Just whispered songs when the nights got cold.
Each verse a breath when the world pushed me down,
Each chorus a raft so I wouldn’t drown.
It ain’t about stages or radio sound—
I sang so I wouldn’t drown.

[Verse 2]
Six years old, sittin’ under broken lights,
Humming hymns to hush the fights.
Neighbors heard but didn’t speak,
Mama’s ghost in every squeaky floor creak.
I carved a melody from rust and pain,
Built a lifeboat out of a poor boy’s name.
No fame in mind, no chart to be found—
I sang so I wouldn’t drown.

[Chorus]
I didn’t sing to be famous, didn’t chase no gold,
Just whispered songs when the nights got cold.
Each verse a breath when the world pushed me down,
Each chorus a raft so I wouldn’t drown.
It ain’t about stages or radio sound—
I sang so I wouldn’t drown.

[Bridge]
Now folks clap and shout my name,
But I still feel that boy the same.
The spotlight shines, but the truth remains,
That little boy still feels the pains.
Behind the mic, beneath the light,
It’s still me singin’ to survive the night.

[Final Chorus]
I didn’t sing to be famous, didn’t want the crown,
Just needed a voice when the world shut down.
Each word a prayer that somehow found
A way to lift me off the ground.
I still ain’t chasin’ glory or renown—
I sing so I won’t drown.

[Outro]
Yeah… I sing so I won’t drown.
Oh... I still sing so I won't drown.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked or lightly strummed), upright bass, subtle brushes on a snare drum, and possibly a mournful harmonica or fiddle in the background. Pedal steel guitar could also subtly add to the atmosphere.
Tempo: Slow to mid-tempo, around 72 BPM, allowing the lyrics and emotions to breathe.
Key: G Major. This key provides a familiar and comfortable sound for country/Americana music, lending to the song's accessibility and emotional impact.
Performance Notes: The vocals should be raw and heartfelt, conveying a sense of vulnerability and authenticity. The instrumentation should be sparse and supportive, never overpowering the vocals. Dynamics are crucial; build from quiet verses to more emotionally powerful choruses. The bridge should have a slight increase in intensity, reflecting the internal conflict of fame versus the original motivation for singing. The outro should fade out slowly, leaving the listener with a feeling of lingering emotion.
Consider adding a brief instrumental break (8 bars) after the second chorus, featuring the harmonica or fiddle, to provide a moment of reflection and further enhance the song's atmosphere.
