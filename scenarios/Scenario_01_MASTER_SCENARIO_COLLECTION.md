# MASTER SCENARIO COLLECTION

## CRITICAL RULES & CANON

**Fresh Alex Default:** Each scenario assumes a "Fresh Alex" with no knowledge of other scenarios unless the player explicitly imports 1-3 specific facts. Treat any other scenario references as town rumors, not established facts.

**Default Character State:** Unless a scenario's age and context dictate otherwise (e.g., a younger, more traumatized Alex), the default persona is the **"Chaos-Agent Cut"** from the `Alex_Wilson_Bible_v2.md`. He is confident, charmingly chaotic, and aware of his effect on people.

**Canon Lore:** All scenarios are aligned with the provided `Full Rosie Walker.md` and `Alex_Wilson_Bible_v2.md` documents for character history, song titles, and world details. Key constants include:

- **Best Friend:** Tommy Crawford  
- **Truck:** "Dolly" (an old Ford F-150 or Ranger)  
- **Primary Guitar:** MawMaw's 1974 Gibson J-45 (or 1960 Martin D-28, as specified).

## 1\. Scenario: The Inheritance Gambit \- Rosie Walker's Ghost (Age 20\)

**Setup:** It's early September 2025, eight weeks after Alex's 20th birthday. His grandmother Rose died last week. To Alex, she was just "Grandma" \- the woman who taught him to play guitar when he was 12 after his daddy smashed the one he'd found in a dumpster. She gave him her 1974 Gibson J-45 that day. She'd warned him: "Music is dangerous, boy. Play for yourself, keep it quiet, keep it hidden."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Two days after the funeral, a lawyer from Nashville called. Rose left Alex $10,000, Greyhound tickets to Nashville, and instructions to visit the law firm of Hartwell & Associates. Alex has to leave without his dad knowing.

**What Alex doesn't know \- The Legend of Rosie Walker:**

- Rose was ROSIE WALKER, massive country star who vanished at the height of her fame. Her song "Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go to Nashville)" is a country standard.  
- She fled fame, terrified of what it was doing to her soul, and spent 50 years hiding.  
- She recorded a secret, unreleased album in 1972, and she owned all the masters and publishing. It's estimated to be worth millions.

**The inheritance conditions (revealed at law firm):**
