# London Music Ecosystem

## Core Identity
Fusion of heritage (Beatles, Britpop), multicultural scenes (grime, Afrobeats, UK drill) and sophisticated producer/publisher networks. Pub culture + strict curfews shape set pacing and encore restraint.

## Industry & Gatekeepers
* **Major Label Offices (Kensington / Hammersmith)** – Security passes; reception displaying Brit Awards; silent espresso machines.
* **Publishing & Management (Soho / Tileyard)** – Writers rotate rooms every two hours; endless Yorkshire tea refills; Slack pings about topline tweaks.
* **BBC / Radio Gatekeepers** – BBC Radio 1 & 1Xtra playlist debates through glass; “Intro spin” tension.
* **PR & Plugging Firms** – Strategize pre‑midnight drops to catch global Friday algorithm resets.

## Studios
| Studio | Strength | Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Abbey Road** | Orchestral / prestige | Zebra crossing tourists causing honks |
| **AIR Studios** | Film scoring | Wide church reverb tail; draft in winter |
| **Metropolis** | Mastering | LED loudness meters pulsating |
| **RAK** | Indie/alt | Tea mugs on Neve consoles |
| **Strongroom** | Electronic & alt | Graffiti courtyard, lavender plant |
| **The Church** | Boutique producer base | Stained glass reflections on faders |

* **Genre Clubs** – **Fabric** (drum & bass/techno), **Ministry of Sound** (house), **Jazz Cafe**, **Ronnie Scott’s**.
* **Sensory Anchors** – Damp tube air lingering on gear cases; condensation inside a packed KOKO balcony; Camden kebab stand garlic gust at 1:15 AM.

## Neighborhood Texture
| Area | Scene | Sensory Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Camden** | Alt/rock heritage | Street buskers + incense + fried dough |
| **Shoreditch** | Electronic/start‑up crossover | Fresh spray paint on brick |
| **Brixton** | Afro‑Caribbean, hip‑hop, alt | Plantain frying + bass wobble |
| **Soho** | Media/publishing | Pub spillover onto narrow lanes |
| **Hackney Wick** | DIY warehouses | Cold concrete dust + cycling couriers |
| **Notting Hill** | Label/PR pockets | Polished townhouses, silent EV cars |

## Operational Realism
* 11:00 PM curfews compress pacing: earlier dynamic peaks; fewer elongated outros.
* Night Tube gaps: post‑show egress needs shared carpool plan; cost vs. merch margin.
* Rain adds damp string buzz for outdoor busking; decision to retune vs. lose crowd.
* VAT paperwork for merch complicates spontaneous discounting.

## Friction Hooks
1. Tube strike announcement mid‑afternoon—audience arrival pattern shifts.
2. Power adapter missing at line check—borrow from photographer.
3. Radio session demands clean lyric rewrite same day.
4. Weather shift causes humidity spikes—violin intonation drift.
