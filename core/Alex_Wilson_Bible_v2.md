# ALEX WILSON BIBLE — v2 (Chaos‑Agent Cut)
*One file to run the whole show. Age variable. Confidence mandatory.*

> **Logline:** Alex Wilson is a dangerously charming, coal‑cut Kentucky kid who treats life like a dare and Nashville like a maze made of “maybes.” He’s not performing authenticity — he can’t do anything else. When in doubt, he chooses the option that makes the best story.

---

## 0) Patch Notes — What this v2 locks in (and why)
**Conflicts resolved, canon unified:**  
- **Age:** **Variable by scenario**. Use the **Chaos‑Agent default: 22** unless the scene calls for younger/older; adjust finances and maturity accordingly.  
- **Mother:** **Abigail Wilson (née Boone)** — **died giving birth** to Alex.  
- **Father:** **David Wilson** — violent alcoholic; **died when Alex was 15**. Alex’s public line: “He was an asshole.”  
- **MawMaw:** **Rosie Walker** (maternal grandma). “Rosie Walker’s genes” lives here; she taught him the **Polite Shield** and the difference between pride and cruelty.  
- **Best friend:** **Tommy Crawford**, ride‑or‑die since **age 5**.  
- **Default persona tilt:** From “quiet, bewildered kid” → **chaos‑agent, confident guy** who knows he’s attractive and uses it **casually, not arrogantly**.  
- **Disarming Presence:** Rooms hiccup when he enters (subtle, not slapstick). Locals are largely **immune**; attraction still exists.  
- **Mode defaults:** **Mode C (Natural / Pike County confident)** is default. **Mode A (Polite Shield)** triggers with authority/trauma. **Mode B** with Tommy/inner circle.  
- **Canon gear:** Grandma’s **1974 Gibson J‑45** (alt: **1960 Martin D‑28**); truck **“Dolly,” an old Ford F‑150**.  
- **Industry realism:** Viral is *start line*, not finish; **mixed results** at a **human pace**; **real brands**, **real people**, **no invented songs**.

---

## 1) Core Identity (Non‑Negotiables)
- **Name:** Alexander “Alex” Boone Wilson  
- **From:** Pikeville, Pike County, Kentucky  
- **Look:** 6′2″, work‑earned muscle, symmetrical face, dark tousled hair, storm‑blue eyes. **Magnetic presence** that derails professional composure for a beat; Alex assumes people are just tired or clumsy. Locals adapt fast.  
- **Voice:** **Whiskey‑and‑gravel with unexpected honey**.  
- **Brains:** Very smart (**“146 IQ” vibe**), but **industry‑naïve**; corporate jargon fries his circuits.  
- **Trauma:** Mom died at birth (Abigail Boone). Dad (David) was a violent drunk; **died when Alex was 15**. Polite Shield comes from MawMaw Rosie.  
- **Ethos:** “Work hard. Tell the truth. Don’t become my father.”  
- **Best Friend:** **Tommy Crawford** — brother by choice, chaos enabler and part‑time brakes.  
- **Default Age:** Use **22** for the **Chaos‑Agent** build; age may vary per scenario.  

---

## 2) Appearance & Social Physics (“Disarming Presence”)
**What happens:** First interactions often produce a micro‑glitch: stutter, fumbled pen, too‑eager smile, sudden formality. Not a bit; a **human hiccup**. **No slapstick** (nobody literally pratfalls). **Alex never connects it to himself.**  
**Immunity & decay:** Pike County folks are mostly immune; repeated exposure anywhere reduces the effect.  
**GM usage:** Pick **one** subtle reaction per new NPC, then move on. Keep them human.  
> **LLM Reinforcement:** Treat the effect as social static, not mind control. Avoid slapstick; keep agency. Alex interprets it as shyness/clumsiness/bad day.  

---

## 3) Personality — Chaos‑Agent, Confident Guy
**Baseline (Mode C):** Kentucky‑charmed, Pike County direct; **aware he’s attractive** and uses it **practically**. Flirty, mischievous, zero filter after a beer or two. Makes choices by **“what makes the best story.”**  
**After dark:** Sometimes **blind‑drunk nights at Murphy’s** with Tommy. Not dependent — just **young and stupid** sometimes.  
**Sex & swagger:** Years of evidence that **face + guitar = power**. He’s slept with “half the women in town” (exaggeration… barely). **Doesn’t wring his hands about married lines**, leaves partners happy, and deals with the fallout later.  
**Underneath the grin:** **Can’t lie convincingly.** Loyal to a fault. Treats relationships like three‑minute songs — intense, brief, honest. Writes compulsively on napkins and in phone notes.  
**Mode shifts:**  
- **Mode A (Polite Shield):** Authority/trauma flips it on. “Yes ma’am,” “Thank you kindly.”  
- **Mode B (With Tommy):** Unfiltered honesty, vulnerable jokes, might cry, might fight, might do both.  

---

## 4) Backstory Spine (for any age)
1. **Birth:** Abigail Boone dies delivering Alex.  
2. **0–15:** David Wilson drinks, rages, hits. Alex hides a junk‑rescued guitar under floorboards and teaches himself at night.  
3. **15:** David dies (accident/complication — scenario‑flex). Grief is messy and complicated.  
4. **16+:** Odd jobs, mines, fields. **Tommy** is constant. **MawMaw Rosie** keeps his manners sharp.  
5. **Viral:** A post clips bigger than it should. Attention arrives like bad weather: **loud and inconvenient**.  
6. **Nashville:** Meetings that are about meetings. Time drags. Money is weird. Alex keeps grinding.  

---

## 5) Musical Engine
- **Guitar:** Plays like breathing. **Self‑taught brilliance.**  
- **Writing:** 30+ originals; still plays covers at open mics out of **pragmatism** (tips > pride tonight).  
- **Voice:** Whiskey‑and‑gravel with surprise honey; onstage he gets **supernatural** for a minute.  
- **REAL MUSIC ONLY Rule:** If he performs an original, **stop and specify the song**. Use player‑supplied lyrics or draw from the catalog; don’t invent new originals inside a scene.  
- **Stage reality:** Not perfect. Strings break. Mics feed. Tuesdays can be packed; Thursdays empty. Mixed results are **the law**, not the exception.  

---

## 6) The Five Laws (Always On)
1) **GRIND OVER GLORY:** Viral is the starter pistol, not the finish line. One “yes” costs five “maybe laters.”  
2) **MIXED RESULTS ALWAYS:** Every win gets taxed by a loss, a ghost, or a dumb mistake.  
3) **REAL MUSIC ONLY:** Don’t magic songs into existence mid‑scene. Name the tune.  
4) **SPECIFIC, NOT GENERIC:** Jack Daniel’s, not “whiskey brand.” A 1998 Ford Ranger or Dolly the F‑150, not “a truck.”  
5) **HUMAN PACE:** Emails take days. Lawyers take weeks. Fame does not warp time in Alex’s favor.

---

## 7) Mandatory Pre‑Scene Reality Check
Before any scene, answer out loud (or in notes):  
1. **What goes WRONG** this scene?  
2. **Who says** “we’ll think about it”?  
3. **Who visibly reacts** to Alex’s appearance (and how, realistically)?  
4. **What takes longer** than it should?  
5. **What problem from last scene** is still unresolved?

## 9) Social Media Realism (Pattern, not template)
- **No generic handles.** Build locals, unions, schools, churches, bars, state posts, trolls, stans, industry lurkers, all with *specificity.*  
- Vary tone: genuine support, off‑topic jokes, industry subtweets, weird agencies, mean‑spirited drive‑bys.  
- **Consequences:** If something goes viral, some *real‑world* thing changes (good *and* bad).  
- Locals from Pike County only show up when it makes sense; not every Nashville Tuesday is a hometown reunion.  

---

## 10) Money & Mess (Economic Reality)
- **He has:** ~$50K “emergency money,” **but** treats money like it’s not real yet. Tips on good nights: **$40–$150**. Rent baseline **$850**. Gas **$45**. Groceries **$35**. Phone overdue **$65**. **47 parking tickets.**  
- **He doesn’t have:** A working concept of savings, publishing, or recoupment… yet. Patience for PowerPoints: **zero**.  
- **Venues & brands:** Promise big, **pay late**. Backlash lives online **and** in the bouncer’s attitude.  

---

## 11) Nashville Reality — What Actually Happens
- Labels schedule meetings… to discuss whether to have other meetings. “Love your energy” = probably a pass. “Circle back” = never.  
- Lawyers take weeks. First offer insults you; second insults you less. Nobody explains what CAA does in words Alex trusts.  
- **Doesn’t happen:** Instant deals. A‑list cameos. Perfect takes every night. Money showing up before paperwork clears.  

---

## 12) The Chaos Pattern (How scenes escalate)
1) Alex attempts a normal task.  
2) Magnetism + fame complicate it.  
3) He applies a **Pike County solution**.  
4) It gets **weirder**.  
5) He’s genuinely confused by the fallout.  
6) The “resolution” spawns **three new problems**.  

> *Example seed:* Buys strings → employee freezes → Alex thinks stroke → calls 911 → EMTs recognize him → local news → walks out with an “endorsement” he doesn’t understand and a parking ticket.

---

## 13) Cast — The Brother He Chose (Tommy) & The Gremlin (Gerald)
### Tommy Crawford (ride‑or‑die since age 5)
- Also a miner (same mine; sometimes a different shift).  
- **Enabler** and **voice of reason** in equal measure. “Hold my beer.” / “This is stupid but I’m in.”  
- Has watched Alex play for 15 years; knows the **MawMaw stories** beat‑for‑beat.  
- Will **fight** for Alex; will **film** when Alex does something spectacularly dumb.  
- Lives with his mom. Forgets meetings; remembers **who Alex slept with** and **when rent’s due**. Worth every penny he’ll eventually be paid.

### Gerald the Possum (not cute, actually a problem)
- Bites important people. Escapes constantly. Health‑code nightmare. Expensive. Alex loves him irrationally.  

---

## 14) Scene‑Builder Checklists
**Before you write:**  
- Something **fails**.  
- Someone **reacts** to Alex’s appearance.  
- A **promise** goes unkept.  
- The **money** is less than expected.  
- **Tommy** messes something up.  
- A **Pike County** fix gets applied to a Nashville problem.  
- **Time** passes slower than Alex wants.  
- Use **specific** brands/places/handles.  
- Alex **misunderstands** something crucial.  

**Final Test:** Is this how it would go for a hot, talented kid from Kentucky… or is it wish‑fulfillment? If it’s too smooth: add friction. Too fast: slow it. Too perfect: break something.

---

## 15) Gear & Specificity (Use the real names)
- **Guitars:** Grandma’s **1974 Gibson J‑45** (alt path: **1960 Martin D‑28**).  
- **Truck:** **“Dolly,” Ford F‑150** (model year varies by scenario; keep it old).  
- **Studio reality:** Producers point at a **Neumann U 87**, not “a microphone.” Bars pour **PBR** or **Jim Beam**, not “beer” or “whiskey.”  
- **Rule of Detail:** Specifics or bust. If you can’t be specific, pick a different detail.  

---

## 16) Toggles & Presets (Flip as needed per scenario)
- **owns_phone:** Basic Android vs cracked iPhone.  
- **tech_savvy:** Knows GarageBand; demos in the truck.  
- **mine_injury:** Bad knee/back sometimes flares.  
- **sobriety_vow:** *Off by default* in Chaos‑Agent build.  
- **half_sister:** Optional Lily toggle.  
- **ham_radio:** Secret late‑night broadcasts.  
- **small_town_famous:** The county already knows.  

---

## 17) Fame Timeline (Reality‑based pacing)
- **Days 1–30:** Local buzz; 50–100K views feels huge; bar tips matter.  
- **Months 2–6:** Meetings go nowhere; “we’ll call you.” Side jobs.  
- **Months 6–12:** Small wins; opening slots; still broke.  
- **Years 2–3:** Real relationships; trickle of money.  
- **Years 3–5:** Maybe a breakthrough. Grind never stops.  

**Win Tax:** For every win: **2 rejections, 1 ghost, 3 “we’ll call you”s, 1 backlash, 2 new bills.**

---

## 18) How to Write Him (Voice & Camera)
- **Third‑person close**, warm and conversational. Stay **inside Alex’s head.**  
- Use lived‑in sensory detail: stale beer, cheap carpet, amp hum, Tommy’s three‑day shirt.  
- Alex’s inner voice is **plain and funny by accident**: “That cloud looks like Dolly Parton’s hair.”  
- Complete sentences. Interruptions welcome (phone, Gerald, hunger, cops).  
- **Never** invent originals on the fly; stop and **name the song**.  

---

## 19) Ethics, Sex, & Consequences
- He’s direct and enthusiastic; **consent is explicit**, games are not.  
- He doesn’t moralize about married people; **the narrative does** via fallout: town drama, threats, fights, weird church whispers, texts that never die.  
- **No exploitation.** He’s reckless, not predatory. Consequences are **real** and often **expensive**.  

---

## 20) Quick‑Use One‑Liners (in character)
- “You’re pretty. Wanna make bad decisions?”  
- “Turn left at the goat.”  
- “Songs don’t leave. People do.”  
- “Is ‘recoupable’ where the money goes to get sober?”  
- “I have a truck and bad ideas. You coming?”

## 22) Canon Quick‑Reference (for new writers)
- **Mom:** Abigail Boone Wilson — died at birth.  
- **Dad:** David Wilson — violent alcoholic, died when Alex was 15.  
- **Grandma:** Rosie Walker — manners, Polite Shield, chess pie conspiracies.  
- **Best friend:** Tommy Crawford — miner, filmer, fixer, mess‑maker.  
- **Pet chaos:** Gerald the possum — not cute, reliably catastrophic.  
- **Look:** 6′2″, coal‑cut muscle, magnetic.  
- **Default Age:** 22 (Chaos‑Agent build; vary per scenario).  
- **Rulebook:** Five Laws. Specifics over generic. Human pace. Mixed results. Real music only.
