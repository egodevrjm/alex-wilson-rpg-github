## Description
A sultry and emotionally raw mid-tempo pop ballad exploring the lingering ache of a dissolving relationship. Alex Wilson's Kentucky baritone delivers poignant lyrics set against a backdrop of atmospheric minimalism. The song blends modern pop sensibilities with classic soul influences, featuring a groove-heavy bassline, subtle slide guitar textures, and layered vocal harmonies that build to a cathartic release in the chorus. The lyrical theme centers around the frustration of emotional distance and the pain of only receiving 'half' of someone's affection, underscored by evocative imagery and soulful chord progressions.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Met you in the quiet part of midnight,
Coffee cup between us like a ceasefire.
You laughed at something that I didn’t say,
I was too busy counting all the ways we’ve changed.
Your hands still dance when you’re explaining,
Your eyes still hide when you’re in pain.
I wanted to ask if you’re okay—
But I’m not the one who gets to anymore.

(Pre-Chorus)
And it’s strange how the truth tastes sweeter in the past,
Like we could’ve made it work if we’d just worked fast.

(Chorus)
I only get half of you now,
Like a song cut off on the radio dial.
You’re here in the room, but miles away somehow,
And I’m still reaching out like a fool—
For half of you.

(Verse 2)
Your phone lights up and you tilt it away,
Say “It’s nothing” but I’ve heard that play.
The way your smile flickers tells the rest,
It’s someone else you’re trying to impress.
And I can’t even say that I blame you,
We’ve both been ghosts since the night we fell through.
But it still kills me every time I see—
What’s left of the love that used to be whole.

(Pre-Chorus)
And it’s cruel how the heart keeps beating out of time,
When the rhythm we had was already dying.

(Chorus)
I only get half of you now,
Like a song cut off on the radio dial.
You’re here in the room, but miles away somehow,
And I’m still reaching out like a fool—
For half of you.

(Bridge)
Maybe one day I’ll hear the rest,
The part where you say you wish me the best.
But right now it’s just static in my head,
And a chorus I can’t forget…

(Chorus)
I only get half of you now,
Like a song cut off on the radio dial.
You’re here in the room, but miles away somehow,
And I’m still reaching out like a fool—
For half of you.

(Outro)
Yeah, I’m still reaching out…
For half of you.
It's all I ever do...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Rhodes piano (gentle tremolo), soft pad synth (long attack/release), finger snaps (subtle and dry), deep sub bass (808-style, melodic), whispered lead vocals (close-mic'd, intimate), muted plucked electric guitar (clean tone with slight chorus), airy harmonies (stacked 3rds and 5ths), pulse kick (4-on-the-floor, heavily sidechained to the kick), wide synth pads (analog-sounding, evolving textures), 808 bass (sustained notes with pitch bends), layered falsetto vocals (processed with light reverb and delay), soft vocal chops (rhythmic stutter effects), clean pop mix (focus on vocal clarity and emotional impact), slide guitar and pedal steel (subtle fills and textures, drenched in reverb), groove-heavy bass (syncopated rhythms, driving the song forward), rhythmic phrasing (varied rhythmic patterns to maintain interest), atmospheric minimalism (sparse instrumentation creating a sense of space and longing).

Performance Notes: The song should be performed with a sense of vulnerability and emotional honesty. The vocal delivery should be nuanced, conveying both the pain of loss and the hope for reconciliation. The instrumental parts should be played with restraint, allowing the vocals to take center stage. The use of dynamics is crucial to building the emotional impact of the song. The bridge should be performed with a sense of quiet desperation, building to the final chorus with increasing intensity. The outro should fade out slowly, leaving the listener with a lingering sense of longing.
