## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
That little plastic savior on my dash
Used to just nod along to Johnny Cash
But now he's got a ring light and a phone
Making TikToks while I'm driving home
He's got a million followers overnight
Posting videos about the dashboard life

[Pre-Chorus]
From blessing my commute to internet fame
Now everybody knows his holy name

[Chorus]
Dashboard Jesus goes viral
Preaching love through the spiral
Of notifications and hearts
He's blessing feeds and shopping carts
Dashboard Jesus, trending now
Still don't judge me anyhow
Just smiles and hits record
My savior's got a blue checkmark, Lord

[Verse 2]
He's got merch deals with the Christian stores
Sponsor codes for heavenly doors
Collabs with every mega church pastor
Miracle content coming faster and faster
But when I'm broke down on Route 23
He still looks back and winks at me

[Pre-Chorus]
From blessing my commute to internet fame
But his love for me ain't changed

[Chorus]
Dashboard Jesus goes viral
Preaching love through the spiral
Of notifications and hearts
He's blessing feeds and shopping carts
Dashboard Jesus, trending now
Still don't judge me anyhow
Just smiles and hits record
My savior's got a blue checkmark, Lord

[Bridge]
Now he's got a podcast and a morning show
But he still rides shotgun wherever I go
Fame ain't changed his plastic heart
He loved me from the very start

[Chorus]
Dashboard Jesus goes viral
Preaching love through the spiral
Of notifications and hearts
He's blessing feeds and shopping carts
Dashboard Jesus, trending now
Still don't judge me anyhow
Just smiles and hits record
My savior's got a blue checkmark, Lord

[Outro]
Dashboard Jesus, oh, Dashboard Jesus
He's always there, when I need us
Dashboard Jesus, yeah

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (steel-string), banjo, light drums (kick, snare, hi-hat), bass guitar, pedal steel guitar, and backing vocals. The song should have a bright, upbeat feel, reflecting the joyful absurdity of the subject matter. The banjo and pedal steel add a country twang, while the drums provide a modern pop sensibility. The acoustic guitar forms the foundation, with the banjo adding playful fills and the pedal steel providing soaring, emotive lines. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, primarily to enhance the chorus. Vocals should be clear and slightly tongue-in-cheek, emphasizing the humorous aspects of the lyrics. Pay attention to the dynamics of the song, building from a quieter verse to a more energetic chorus. The bridge should have a slightly more reflective tone before returning to the final chorus. Consider adding a short instrumental break featuring the banjo or pedal steel after the second chorus. The outro should fade out slowly, leaving the listener with a feeling of lighthearted amusement.
Tempo: Medium-fast, around 120 BPM. 
Key: G Major
