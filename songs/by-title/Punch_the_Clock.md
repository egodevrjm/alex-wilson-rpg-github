## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Wake up, hit snooze, there’s a war in my head,
Tie on this noose they call a necktie instead.
Coffee in a paper cup, two bucks short,
Same four walls in my name badge fort.
The boss says “son, gotta give your all,”
But my mind’s on the beach, not this cubicle stall.

(Pre-Chorus)
Every tick of the hand’s like it’s laughin’ at me,
But I’m runnin’ my own countdown secretly—

(Chorus)
Punch the clock, and I’m gone at five,
‘Cause my real life starts when I leave this grind.
Gonna turn that paycheck into champagne night,
Let the suit hit the floor under neon light.
Punch the clock, yeah, I’m breakin’ free,
From the nine-to-fake that’s been breakin’ me.
All week long I’ve been workin’ to live,
Now it’s time to cash out what my soul can give.

(Verse 2)
Emails stacking like a bad Jenga game,
Reply-all drama, man, it’s always the same.
Boss walks in like he owns my name,
But I’m runnin’ playlists, not playin’ his game.
Calendar full but my heart’s checked out,
Friday’s in my veins and it’s screamin’ loud.

(Pre-Chorus)
Every “urgent” ping just fuels my plan,
To clock out faster than this old sedan—

(Chorus)
Punch the clock, and I’m gone at five,
‘Cause my real life starts when I leave this grind.
Gonna turn that paycheck into champagne night,
Let the suit hit the floor under neon light.
Punch the clock, yeah, I’m breakin’ free,
From the nine-to-fake that’s been breakin’ me.
All week long I’ve been workin’ to live,
Now it’s time to cash out what my soul can give.

(Bridge)
This tie’s a leash and I’m chewin’ right through,
There’s a better me waitin’ after this view.
I’m a weekend warrior with a Friday crown,
King of the night when the sun goes down.

(Guitar Solo)
(A short, funky guitar solo over the pre-chorus chords)

(Final Chorus)
Punch the clock, and I’m out that door,
Like I’ve never seen spreadsheets before.
Gonna swap this desk for a dance floor glow,
Trade my inbox for a sold-out show.
Punch the clock, yeah, I’m takin’ mine,
Gonna spend my freedom like it’s fine red wine.
All week long I’ve been workin’ to live—
Now it’s time to cash out what my soul can give.

(Outro)
Punch the clock…
(Yeah!)
And let my real life in.
(Oh, let it in!)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation Details:
*   **Drums:** Punchy, primarily live kit sound with subtle programmed claps and snares added for depth. Consider using a gated reverb on the snare for a more pronounced 80s-inspired feel.
*   **Bass:** A tight, syncopated bassline is crucial, emphasizing the 'funk' aspect. Consider a slap bass section in the bridge or pre-chorus for added energy.
*   **Guitar:** Clean electric guitar chops on the upbeat, with occasional wah or envelope filter for added funk flavor. A short, melodic guitar solo can follow the second chorus, building into the bridge.
*   **Horns:** Staccato horn stabs are key for energy; think Tower of Power or early Maroon 5. Layered trumpets, trombones, and saxophones will add depth.
*   **Keys:** Minimal keys in the verses, focusing on Rhodes piano or a simple organ comp. Choruses feature big synth pads (Sawtooth or Juno-style) to fill out the soundscape.
*   **Vocals:** Charismatic and playful vocal delivery. Encourage conversational phrasing in verses, with a belted/falsetto mix in the hook for pop punch. Harmonies should be stacked and tight in the choruses.
*   **Production:** Focus on a clean, modern sound with strong stereo imaging. Ensure the bass is tight and punchy, and the drums have plenty of presence. The vocal should be front and center, but not overpowering the instrumentation.
*   **Tempo:** Maintain a consistent tempo of 110 BPM. A slight push in tempo leading into the choruses could add excitement.
*   **Arrangement:** The song benefits from dynamic variation. The verses are stripped down, building gradually to the pre-chorus. The bridge provides a contrast before a massive final chorus.
