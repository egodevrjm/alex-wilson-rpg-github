**RE: Mutual Release and Termination of Agreement dated April 15, 1963**  
  
Dear Mr. Sholes,  
  
This letter shall serve as a legally binding instrument confirming the mutual agreement between your client, RCA Records (hereinafter "RCA"), and our client, Ms. Rose Marie Hatfield, professionally known as Rosie Walker (hereinafter "Artist"), regarding the conclusion of her contractual obligations.  
  
As of December 31, 1972, the ten-year term of the Recording Artist Agreement executed on April 15, 1963, has been fulfilled. In accordance with the terms of that agreement and subsequent discussions, both parties agree to the following conditions to finalize their professional relationship:  
  
1.  RCA Records, its parent companies, subsidiaries, and successors-in-interest, hereby **relinquishes any and all claims, in perpetuity, to any and all new creative works, including but not limited to musical compositions, lyrical works, and sound recordings, created by the Artist on or after January 1, 1973.** The Artist shall retain full and unencumbered ownership of any such future works, free from any claim of right or interest by RCA.  
  
2.  In consideration of the foregoing, the Artist agrees to release RCA from any and all further obligations or liabilities pertaining to the aforementioned 1963 agreement. This release does not affect any royalty obligations for works created and recorded during the contract term, which shall continue to be administered as specified therein.  
  
This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the termination of the Artist's contract and supersedes all prior discussions and understandings. Both parties acknowledge that they have sought independent legal counsel and enter into this agreement freely and with full understanding of its terms.  
  
We believe this concludes the matter to the satisfaction of both parties.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Elias Vance
