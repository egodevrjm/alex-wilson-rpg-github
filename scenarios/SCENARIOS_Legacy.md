## 1. Scenario: The Inheritance Gambit - Rosie Walker's Ghost (Age 20)

**Setup:** It's early September 2025, eight weeks after Alex's 20th birthday (July 12). His grandmother Rose died last week. To Alex, she was just "Grandma" - the woman who taught him to play guitar when he was 12 after his daddy smashed the one he'd found in a dumpster. She gave him her 1959 Martin D-28 (Betty) that day, though it always seemed to make her sad when he played. She'd warned him: "Music is dangerous, boy. Play for yourself, keep it quiet, keep it hidden."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

Two days after the funeral, a lawyer from Nashville called. Rose left Alex $10,000 (already deposited), Greyhound tickets to Nashville, and instructions to visit the law firm of Hartwell & Associates within 10 days. Alex has to leave without his dad knowing - David Wilson would drink that money and beat Alex for having it.

**The family tragedy Alex knows:**
- Grandma Rose raised him after mom (Abigail) died in childbirth
- Dad (David) was a good man once, but losing his wife broke him
- Dad blamed Alex for Abigail's death, beat him from age 2
- Grandma tried to protect him, taught him to cook, to survive
- She loved hearing him play but always looked haunted by it

**What Alex doesn't know - The Legend of Rosie Walker:**
- Rose was ROSIE WALKER, massive country star 1971-1974
- Three perfect chart-toppers: "Wildfire Hearts," "Kentucky Rain," and "Coal Dust Madonna"
- Vanished at height of fame after her Grand Ole Opry finale - biggest mystery in country music
- "Coal Dust Madonna" has been covered by everyone from Dolly to Cash to modern stars
- r/RosieWalkerMystery has 45K members still hunting for answers
- She fled fame, terrified of what it was doing to her soul
- Married good man John Wilson in Pikeville, had son David
- When Abigail died and David turned violent, Rose saw history repeating
- She spent 50 years hiding from her gift while watching David try to beat Alex's gift out of him

**The inheritance conditions (revealed at law firm):**
1. Visit the vault containing her complete history - journals, photos, the truth
2. Read her letter explaining why she ran and why she regrets teaching Alex to hide
3. Live in a Nashville content house for 3 months (always-on streaming, content creators, zero privacy)
4. Perform three original songs at the Bluebird Cafe within those 3 months
5. If he completes all conditions: inherits everything including...

**The secret album:**
- Rose recorded a complete album in 1974 nobody knows exists
- She owned all masters and publishing rights
- Worth estimated $50-100 million if released
- Contains the answer to why she really left

**The content house (Marcus's place):**
- Six residents: makeup artist, chef, gamer, lifestyle vlogger, fitness influencer, and one empty room
- 24/7 streaming in common areas to Twitch/YouTube/TikTok
- Rent covered for Alex's three months by the estate
- They think they're getting "some country kid who plays guitar"
- Marcus stuttered on the phone because even Alex's voice affects people

**Rose's final wish (in her letter):**
- Alex must make it on his OWN merit first
- Can't reveal he's Rosie Walker's grandson until after the Bluebird
- She realized too late she was wrong to make him hide
- Watching David beat the music out of Alex while she did nothing haunts her
- "Don't be the coward I was. Face the light I ran from."

**Scene opens:** Tuesday, 5:47 AM, Pikeville Greyhound station. Alex stands with his duffel and the Martin case, wearing his least-worn flannel and the only jeans without holes. The $10,000 sits alien in his account - more money than he's ever imagined. His flip phone shows three texts from Dad: "Where's the truck?" "Boy, you better answer." "I'm coming to the Piggly Wiggly." The bus driver, a middle-aged woman, takes one look at Alex and drops her coffee. "Sorry ma'am," he says automatically, grabbing paper towels from his bag. "Gerald - that's what I call the coffee machine here - makes it extra hot." The bus is boarding. Nashville is 4 hours away. His dad will be at the Piggly Wiggly in 20 minutes. Time to choose: the familiar hell or the unknown.

---

## 2. Scenario: The Texas Redemption - Breaking the Cycle (Age 14-15)

**Setup:** It's late June 2020. Alex is 14, will turn 15 on July 12. Though at 6'2" with muscle earned from working fields since age six, everyone assumes he's 18. Three weeks ago, Mrs. Henderson saw him changing shirts behind the Piggly Wiggly - the map of scars made her sob before calling 911. What she saw: belt marks layered over burns, old breaks that healed wrong, the word "KILLER" carved into his shoulder blade (his father's drunken reminder that Alex "killed" his mother in childbirth).

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The investigation uncovered:**
- Medical records from Dr. Sawyer who treated Alex secretly since age 4
- Receipts from three farms showing Alex worked 60-hour weeks every summer since age 8
- School attendance records: missed 40% of classes to cover his father's shifts
- Tommy Harlan's testimony: saw David Wilson beat Alex with a tire iron at age 10
- The "work ledger" David kept, selling Alex's labor and pocketing $30K over nine years

Alex ran the moment he heard "placement." He's been in the Daniel Boone Forest for 12 days, living better than he has in years. Built a shelter that impressed even the park rangers who found it. Named every rock and tree. Earl the moonshiner brings him cornbread, calls him "the boy who shouldn't have survived."

**The pursuit team:**
- Ms. Patricia Reeves: 30-year veteran, has Alex's file memorized - 47 documented injuries before age 10
- Sheriff Tom Bradshaw: Found Alex working Henderson's field at age 7 during school hours, did nothing
- Deputy Jake Collins: Young, eager, about to see something that'll haunt him
- Dr. Ellen Harper: Trauma specialist, flew in from Louisville, specializes in "feral children"

**What will happen after the creek (GM knowledge only):**
- Alex tries to run, catches ankle in brambles hidden by leaves
- Rolls down 30-foot embankment, hits head on rock, knocked unconscious
- Wakes in hospital, panics so severely they have to restrain him
- Full medical workup reveals: 14 badly healed fractures, severe malnutrition, untreated pneumonia, partial deafness in left ear from repeated blows
- Psychiatric eval: Complex PTSD, attachment disorder, but shows "remarkable emotional regulation through self-soothing behaviors" (humming, pattern-making)
- The group home discussion sends him into such severe panic he stops breathing
- Ms. Patricia spends 72 hours calling programs nationwide, crying between calls

**The Texas connection (revealed gradually):**
- David Coleman saw security footage of Alex at a gas station - threw a rock 70 yards to save a kid from a dog
- Coleman lost his own son to abuse, founded his program as penance
- Maria Coleman grew up in Kentucky foster care, knows the system's failures
- They specifically requested "the unsurvivable cases"
- Program has taken 31 boys deemed "unfixable" - all 31 are now in college or trades
- Located on a 500-acre ranch where boys work with horses ("can't lie to a horse")
- Alex won't know destination until boarding the plane

**Hidden detail:** Alex carries a photo of his mother hidden in his boot. He talks to it at night, apologizing for being born.

**Scene opens:** Dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is teaching himself to juggle river stones while testing echo patterns - he's named each echo point after someone who was kind to him (there are only four names). He's humming a melody that sounds ancient, something his grandma taught him. Through the morning mist, he sees Sheriff Bradshaw, who takes one look at Alex's face and literally walks into a low-hanging branch. "You okay there, Sheriff?" Alex calls out, genuinely concerned. "These woods can be tricky if you don't know them. Want some creek coffee? That's what I call boiled pine needles - tastes like Gerald's coffee at the station, but free." The Sheriff's hand moves to his radio. Alex's body goes rigid, hypervigilant, already calculating escape routes. The humming stops.

---

## 3. Scenario: The California Promise - The Prodigy Papers (Age 11-12)

**Setup:** It's early July 2017. Alex is 11, will turn 12 on July 12. Though at 5'10" with the face of a Disney Prince that makes grown women forget their own names, everyone assumes he's 15. His father died six weeks ago - drunk, drove into a telephone pole at 87 mph. The funeral had seven people: Alex, the minister, and five men who wanted to make sure David Wilson was really dead.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

Alex has been living in the forest since they put his father in the ground. Not running from anyone - there was nowhere to run TO. No relatives came forward. They all knew what David was, watched Alex show up to church with black eyes, saw him working fields at age 6, and did nothing but slip him food when David wasn't looking.

**What the investigation found in the trailer:**
- The "Work Ledger": detailed records of Alex's labor since age 6, $42,000 collected over six years
- Hospital bills (unpaid): broken ribs at 3, fractured skull at 5, dislocated shoulder at 7
- Alex's hidden journal (under floorboards): heartbreaking entries about "trying to be good enough that daddy won't hurt me"
- 47 empty whiskey bottles in Alex's closet (David would lock him in there for days)
- Grandmother's guitar, hidden so well David never found it
- Academic tests from school: IQ of 147, reading at college level, perfect pitch noted by music teacher

**Life in the woods - not survival, but thriving:**
- Built a shelter that an Eagle Scout leader called "architecturally impossible for a child"
- Trained three raccoons to harmonize (he calls them "The Church Ladies")
- Trading fish with Earl for books - currently reading Steinbeck
- Created an elaborate water filtration system from trash
- Has been leaving fresh fish on the doorsteps of families who once helped him
- At night, plays guitar so beautifully that hikers report "angel sightings" in the forest

**The pursuit team:**
- Ms. Patricia Reeves: Has cried over Alex's file every night for three weeks
- Sheriff Bradshaw: Found a photo of Alex at age 4 in his files - realizes he could have saved him eight years ago
- Dr. Ellen Harper: Child psychologist, specializes in "twice-exceptional" children (gifted + traumatized)
- Father Miguel: Local priest who has been leaving food at the forest edge, praying for forgiveness

**What will happen after the creek (GM knowledge only):**
- Alex slips on wet rocks trying to back away, cuts palm to the bone on sharp shale
- Twists knee badly, can't run, goes into shock from the sight of his own blood (trauma response)
- Hospital exam: 17 poorly healed fractures, cigarette burns in pattern that spells "MINE", severe dental damage
- Trauma eval reveals: genius IQ paired with severe attachment disorder, treats objects as friends to cope with isolation
- Apologizes compulsively for existing, flinches at raised hands but immediately says "I'm sorry for flinching"
- Group home mention triggers catastrophic panic: "I won't go in another cage! I'll be good! I'll be quiet!"
- Has to be sedated when he starts hitting himself, screaming "I killed her" (his mother)

**The UCLA connection (develops organically):**
- Dr. Sarah Chen-Martinez reviews case file, recognizes patterns from her research
- Her study: "Extraordinary Resilience in Severe Childhood Trauma" - Alex fits every marker
- James Martinez (her husband) sees video of Alex playing guitar, calls it "generational talent"
- They've been trying to adopt for five years, failed fertility treatments nearly broke their marriage
- Sarah's own trauma: grew up with narcissistic mother, understands emotional abuse
- Their Griffith Observatory home has a music studio James built for the child they never had
- Three youth basketball coaches have already called Sarah begging for "any tall kid"

**The legal complexity:**
- Alex is technically an heir to his grandmother's estate (she had more than anyone knew)
- Three relatives suddenly interested when they hear there might be money
- State wants to make him a ward, use his case for new legislation
- Media caught wind: "Wild Child of Pike County" trending on social media

**Scene opens:** Pre-dawn at Troublesome Creek. Alex is teaching himself to juggle rocks while humming a melody that sounds like it came from another century - something his grandmother sang when she thought no one was listening. "Helps me think in patterns," he tells the raccoons. "Like when daddy was deciding whether to use his fists or his belt, there was always a pattern. Two beers meant hands, five meant belt, ten meant hide." Through the mist, Sheriff Bradshaw approaches slowly. Alex looks up with those impossibly blue eyes and offers a smile that makes the Sheriff forget how to breathe. "Morning, Sheriff. You're up awful early. Bad dreams? I get those too. Want some creek coffee? That's what I call boiled pine needles - tastes terrible but it's better than thinking." His hand instinctively moves toward the hidden knife in his boot, body coiled to run. He's calculating how deep the creek is, whether he can make it across before they catch him.

## 4. Scenario: The Highway Hymnal - American Odyssey (Age 22)

**Setup:** It's October 14th, 2027. Alex is 22 (born July 12, 2005). Yesterday at 7 AM, everything collapsed in 12 hours:
- 7 AM: Pink slip at Cochran Mine - "restructuring" eliminated 180 jobs, destroying Pikeville
- Noon: Amy's text from Cincinnati - "Can't watch you die in that town like your father. Found someone with ambition. Don't call."
- 3 PM: Dolly threw a rod through the block - the F-150 he'd rebuilt seven times finally gave up
- 6 PM: Eviction notice - two months behind, landlord's selling to developers
- 11 PM: Found his father's journal in a box - detailed plans to "beat the music out of the boy"

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**What Alex carries:**
- Grandmother's Martin D-28 (now named "Rose" - he doesn't know why that name feels right)
- Army surplus duffel: 3 pairs of jeans, 5 t-shirts, leather jacket his mother wore (hidden from father for 22 years)
- $247 cash (last paycheck minus what he owed Murphy's)
- Flip phone with 7 numbers saved (all disconnected except Murphy's bar)
- Photo of his mother, edges worn from handling
- Harmonica she played while pregnant (according to Mrs. Henderson)

**The ride:**
- Tommy Harlan hauling lumber to Lexington, talking about his son in Afghanistan
- Tommy's been stealing glances in the mirror, nearly rear-ended three cars
- Keeps offering Alex money, food, "anything you need, son"
- Has already texted his wife about "the Wilson boy finally getting out"

**What's already in motion (Alex doesn't know):**
- Amy's TikTok of him playing guitar has 847K views, titled "My ex is too good for this world"
- Comments: "WHO IS THIS?" "Voice like bourbon and broken glass" "I would die for him"
- Three Nashville scouts have been in Pikeville for weeks chasing "Pikeville Phantom" rumors
- The ham radio community has been sharing recordings of someone playing at 2 AM
- Eddie Murphy has been telling everyone Alex is "the one who got away from becoming his father"

**The circuit ahead (his father's ghost):**
- David Wilson played this same circuit 1995-1998 before Abigail "trapped him"
- Left debts in 7 cities, broken hearts in 12, and one paternity suit in Memphis
- Some bars still have his photo: "DO NOT SERVE - VIOLENT WHEN DRUNK"
- But also left believers: "Best damn voice I ever heard until the whiskey took it"

**The plan (if you can call it that):**
- Busk until he has gas money
- Sleep in parks until he has motel money
- Play any bar that'll have him for tips
- Head south before winter (he's heard Austin doesn't get snow)
- Don't become his father

**Hidden opportunities on the road:**
- The Broken Spoke, Austin: Tuesday open mic launched three Nashville careers
- Beale Street, Memphis: Old-timers who remember his father, might help or might call the cops
- The Basement, Nashville: Scout's row every Thursday
- Red Rocks employees-only jam session: Janitor is actually a retired label exec

**Scene opens:** Downtown Lexington, 2nd and Main, 4:47 PM. October wind cutting through his flannel. Alex stands outside a closed Chase Bank, guitar case open at his feet. Rush hour - hundreds of people passing. A businesswoman in a $3,000 suit approaches, makes eye contact, and walks directly into a newspaper box, scattering her papers. "Ma'am, you alright?" Alex rushes to help, gathering her documents. "These city sidewalks are tricky - all flat and same-looking. Not like home where every pothole has a personality." She stammers something, drops a $20 in his case, and flees. "But I haven't even played yet," Alex calls after her. "City folks sure are generous!" He looks at the $20 - more than he's ever made without bleeding for it. Tests the echo between the buildings, names it "Margaret" after the banker who secretly helped his grandma escape Nashville. Positions his fingers on the frets. [What song does Alex play? If original, please provide title and lyrics.]

## 5. Scenario: The Murphy's Bar Revelation - Lightning in a Bottle (Age 20)

**Setup:** It's November 8th, 2025, Friday night. Alex is 20 (turned 20 on July 12, 2025), eight months into working Cochran Mine's night shift. Every Friday for six months, he's brought his grandmother's 1960 Martin D-28 to Murphy's - not to play, just habit from practicing in Dolly during break. The guitar stays in the case while he drinks exactly three beers, pays his tab, and leaves by 9 PM.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**Murphy's Bar - A Character Itself:**
- Established 1947 by Eddie's grandfather, a moonshiner who went legal
- Perfect acoustics by accident - something about the tin ceiling and oak beams
- Where Johnny Cash played in 1955 (there's a photo, young and hungry)
- Where Loretta Lynn got discovered (Eddie's dad swears it's true)
- The back booth where every Pikeville deal, legal and otherwise, gets made
- The bullet hole in the mirror from 1987 (nobody talks about it)
- Capacity: 67, but fire marshal always looks the other way

**Tonight's crowd:**
- The regulars: 15 Pikeville lifers, immune to Alex's charm, protective of him
- Eddie Murphy: 65 today, three bourbons deep, nostalgic and pushy
- Bachelorette party from Louisville: 8 women, got lost finding Natural Bridge
- Bride-to-be: Madison Hayes, elementary teacher, marrying an accountant
- Becca Chen: Bridesmaid, 2.3M TikTok followers, documenting "Real Kentucky"
- Three Nashville session musicians: Driving through, heard about Murphy's reputation
- Amy (watching from Cincinnati): Her friend's Instagram story is live

**The six-month buildup:**
- Every Friday, old-timers say: "Wilson, play something" / Alex: "Just carry it for the memories"
- Eddie's been telling everyone: "That boy's got something, won't share it"
- The guitar case has become Murphy's mystery - bets on if he can actually play
- Mrs. Murphy (Eddie's wife): "It's like watching someone hold their breath for six months"

**Eddie's birthday ultimatum:**
- "Wilson! One song for my birthday or you're barred for a month!"
- The threat's empty - Alex owes $47, Eddie would forgive it anyway
- But Eddie's eyes are wet: "My dad heard Johnny here. I want to hear YOU."
- The whole bar goes quiet - even Gerald (the ancient AC unit) seems to pause

**What's about to happen (nobody knows):**
- Becca's phone is propped on her Corona, already streaming to 50K viewers
- Title: "LOST IN KENTUCKY - WEIRD BAR EDITION"
- The Nashville musicians will recognize something extraordinary
- The bachelorettes will abandon their party to listen
- Madison will call off her wedding (she realizes this hearing Alex)
- The video will hit 1M views in 4 hours
- #MurphysBarGuy will trend globally by midnight
- Three record labels will have scouts driving to Pikeville by dawn

**Alex's relationship with performing:**
- Never played at school (father would have heard)
- Never played at church ("music is the devil's work" - David Wilson)
- Never played for girlfriends (too intimate, too revealing)
- Only played for grandma, and she always cried
- The guitar is his diary, therapist, only trusted friend
- Playing in public feels like standing naked in church

**The moment before:**
- Coal dust still under his nails from morning shift (worked 16 hours)
- Hands shake slightly - exhaustion or nerves, hard to tell
- Wearing his grandfather's flannel (found it in grandma's closet)
- The Martin feels heavier than the coal equipment
- Names the mic "Sister Sarah" after the teacher who taught him to read

**Scene opens:** Alex reluctantly takes the tiny corner stage, a single amber bulb casting shadows. The Martin's case clicks open - several people gasp at the guitar's condition (pristine, vintage, worth $40K). "Sorry, Miss Margaret," he whispers to the guitar. "I know you deserve better than coal dust and spilled beer." The bride-to-be's phone slips into her drink. Someone drops a beer bottle - it doesn't break, just rolls loudly across the floor. "Gerald - that's what I call the sound system - is being temperamental," Alex says as feedback squeals. Eddie dims the lights without being asked. "This is about someone who wasn't worth the trouble." His fingers find the strings. "Sorry if I mess it up, Mr. Murphy. I've never done this with people watching." The first note rings out - pure, clear, like a bell in a cavern. The Nashville musicians exchange looks that say "holy shit." Becca's viewer count jumps to 75K. [What song does Alex play? If original, please provide title and lyrics.]

## 6. Scenario: The Mine Collapse Vigil - Songs Through Stone (Age 19)

**Setup:** It's March 3rd, 2025, 11:47 AM. The earth screamed. Cochran Mine's Tunnel 4 - the "safe" one, the "modern" one - folded like paper. Seven men inside:
- Tommy Harlan (47): Taught Alex everything, has three kids, coaches little league
- Old Pete Sawyer (61): Shares his lunch with Alex daily, one year from retirement
- Marcus Chen (29): Mining engineer, just married, wife is pregnant
- The Kowalski brothers (35, 33): Polish immigrants, send money home
- Junior Henderson (22): Started same day as Alex, they're shift partners
- Bill "Preacher" Williams (55): Leads prayer circle before every shift

It's been 16 hours. Rescue teams saying 48-72 hours minimum to break through safely. The families haven't moved from the entrance.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The gathering:**
- 47 family members in folding chairs, wrapped in Red Cross blankets
- CNN, Fox, MSNBC trucks arrived hours ago
- Governor's helicopter landed at noon
- 200+ townspeople bringing food, coffee, prayers
- Mine company executives in a trailer, lawyers on speakerphone
- MSHA officials taking statements, measuring blame

**The women:**
- Mary Harlan: Holding Tommy's favorite coffee mug, hasn't spoken in 5 hours
- Lucy Harlan (8): Drew pictures for daddy - "COME HOME" in crayon
- Ethel Sawyer: Brought Pete's heart medication "for when he comes up"
- Lin Chen: Six months pregnant, refusing to sit down
- The prayer circle: 20 church ladies humming hymns in shifts

**The moment building:**
- Mrs. Harlan remembers: "Tommy says that Wilson boy sings like an angel"
- Word spreads through the crowd: "Alex could sing something"
- Not for the cameras, not for hope, but for the men below
- "Sound travels through rock," someone says (it doesn't, not like this)
- "They'll hear it," insists Lucy. "Daddy will hear it."

**What Alex knows about death and waiting:**
- Watched his mother die over 14 hours during birth
- Sat with his grandmother's body for six hours before calling anyone
- Waited in the hospital while his father was in surgery after a mine accident
- Knows the weight of hope that's probably false
- Knows sometimes false hope is all you have

**What's already in motion:**
- Channel 5 has been live for 14 hours straight
- #PrayForCochranSeven trending nationally
- Three Nashville scouts in town chasing "Pikeville Phantom" rumors
- The miners' families have been recording everything on phones
- A documentary crew was already in town filming "Death of Coal Country"

**What will happen (nobody expects):**
- Alex's voice will carry beautifully in the night air
- CNN will cut to him mid-song, no context needed
- The recording will be played at every funeral if needed
- But the men below will swear - SWEAR - they heard something
- Junior will say it gave them strength to last 82 hours
- Tommy will name his next grandchild Alex

**Alex's relationship with these men:**
- Tommy: Father figure, taught him to be a man not a monster
- Pete: Shared wisdom and sandwiches, never asked for anything
- Junior: Only real friend his age, they compete over everything
- These aren't strangers - they're the closest thing to family he has left

**Scene opens:** The mine entrance, harsh under emergency flood lights. It's 28 degrees, breath visible, ice forming on the puddles from the fire hoses. Alex stands in his mining gear - they called everyone in when it happened, he's been here since noon. Coal dust still caked on his face, creating rivulets where tears have been. Mrs. Harlan's hand finds his arm, her fingers ice cold. "Please, Alex. Tommy talks about you all the time. Says you got a voice that could wake the dead or calm the dying. Just... sing something. Anything. So they know we're here. So they know we haven't given up." Lucy tugs his other hand, holds up her drawing. The CNN camera operator, a hardened war correspondent, is already crying. The governor stops mid-conversation. Alex looks at Dolly, parked crooked in the mud, the Martin visible through the back window. "I don't know if it'll help, Mrs. Harlan." "Nothing will help," she says. "But nothing's all we got." [What song does Alex play? If original, please provide title and lyrics.]

## 7. Scenario: The Wedding Crasher's Revenge - The Song She Needed (Age 19)

**Setup:** It's June 21st, 2025. Amy Stevens is marrying Chase Matthews at the Pikeville Country Club. The wedding cost $75,000 (Chase's daddy owns three Ford dealerships). 200 guests. Amy's in a $6,000 dress that doesn't fit right because she lost 30 pounds from "wedding stress" (Chase's pills).

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The real story of Amy and Alex:**
- Together since sophomore year, she was his first everything
- She'd sneak him food when his dad locked him out
- Held him through panic attacks after beatings
- Only person besides grandma who heard him play
- Left him six months ago: "You're drowning in this town and taking me with you"
- Started dating Chase two weeks later (she'd been texting him for months)

**Chase Matthews - The Wrong Man:**
- 24, dealer's son, "reformed" after daddy's lawyer kept him out of prison
- Got Amy hooked on Adderall, then Xanax, now she needs both to function
- Already cheating with Brittany in Louisville (everyone knows except Amy)
- Hit Amy once; she told people she walked into a door
- Groomsmen are his dealing crew - armed, dangerous, high at the reception

**The text from Emma (Amy's 16-year-old sister):**
8:42 PM: "Alex PLEASE. She's been crying since 10 AM. Threw up twice. Mom had to force her down the aisle."
8:43 PM: "Chase is wasted. His friend grabbed my ass. Security is his cousins."
8:44 PM: "Found Amy crying in bathroom. Says she made a mistake. Still loves you."
8:45 PM: "Band on break. Service door by kitchen unlocked for 2 mins. PLEASE."

**What Emma doesn't know she's setting in motion:**
- Three groomsmen carry guns, looking for any excuse
- Wedding photographer is actually documenting "Real Kentucky" for VICE
- Madison Whitfield (mayor's daughter) is streaming everything
- Amy's dad has Alex's dad's shotgun in his truck "just in case"
- But also: half the wedding party knows Amy is miserable

**The Country Club:**
- Where Alex's mother worked as a server before she married David
- Where David proposed to her (staff break room, actually romantic then)
- Where Alex was never allowed - "not our kind of place"
- Security specifically has his photo: "Wilson boy - do not admit"

**Amy's wedding playlist (she made it thinking of Alex):**
- First dance: "Tennessee Whiskey" (their song)
- Father-daughter: "I Loved Her First" (Alex taught her dad that song)
- Every song a memory, a message, a regret

**What's in Alex's truck:**
- The Martin, always
- The song he wrote after she left (never played for anyone)
- Engagement ring he'd been saving for (pawn shop special, but real)
- Her favorite flannel she left at his place
- Six months of unread texts he typed but never sent

**The moment before the moment:**
- Reception in full swing, but energy is wrong
- Amy's smile looks painted on, she flinches when Chase touches her
- Guests whispering about "young love" but meaning "what a mistake"
- Chase's seventh drink since dinner
- His groomsman Jake just offered Emma cocaine in front of her parents

**Scene opens:** Pikeville Country Club parking lot, 8:43 PM. Alex sits in Dolly, engine off to save gas. Through the ballroom windows: crystal chandeliers, women in gowns, men in suits worth more than his truck. Amy in white, looking like a ghost at her own funeral. The Martin case on the passenger seat feels heavier than it ever has. His phone buzzes: "NOW. Kitchen door. Security's gone to smoke. Amy just ran to the bathroom crying. Chase is doing shots." Alex's hands shake as he reaches for the guitar. This is insane. This is dangerous. This is necessary. The song in his chest has been burning for six months. Through the window, he sees Emma frantically waving from a service door. Two minutes to change everything or lose everything. He thinks of his mother, who died before she could escape. Thinks of Amy, still alive but dying inside. Opens the truck door. [What song does Alex play? If original, please provide title and lyrics.]

## 8. Scenario: The Livestream Accident - Digital Destiny (Age 18)

**Setup:** It's September 15th, 2023, a Tuesday that started like any other. Alex is 18, three months out of high school, working at Henderson's Auto Repair because the mine isn't hiring. His coworker Brad Turner (22) runs a small Twitch stream: "RealKentuckyLife" - usually 30-40 viewers watching him rebuild engines and complain about tourists. Brad's got the flu, called Alex last night begging.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**Brad's desperate pitch:**
"Just prop the phone up and work. Talk about what you're doing. I'll lose partner if I miss another stream. You know cars, you can talk about carburetors or whatever. Please, man. You're saving my life."

**What Alex understands about streaming:**
- "So it's like TV but on a phone?"
- "People watch other people work? Why?"
- "Chat? Like a party line?"
- "Mods? Like car mods?"
- Thinks "going viral" means getting sick from the internet

**The stream setup:**
- Title: "SECRET GUEST MECHANIC!" (Brad being cryptic for engagement)
- Brad's usual 37 subscribers waiting
- Stream scheduled 8 AM - 5 PM
- Phone taped to a toolbox with duct tape
- Chat moving slowly: weather, trucks, usual stuff

**The perfect storm brewing:**
- Hans from Berlin: Watches every "authentic American" stream, documents Americana
- Three Nashville interns: Brad's cousin works at Big Machine, they watch to support
- Chelsea (Brad's ex): Bitter, watching to see if he mentions her
- Algorithm: About to pick up "Secret Guest" and push it
- Auto-host: Seventeen bigger channels will host when hosts raid

**Lunch routine (what Alex always does):**
- Noon sharp: wipes hands, grabs bologna sandwich from the mini fridge
- Takes the phone (thinks he's being polite showing viewers his lunch spot)
- Sits in Dolly's bed with his back against the cab
- Eats exactly half the sandwich
- Plays guitar for exactly 20 minutes ("helps digestion," grandma said)
- Today: the song about his father he's never played for anyone

**What's about to happen in 20 minutes:**
- 12:00 - Viewer count: 47
- 12:03 - First clip posted to r/UnexpectedMusic
- 12:05 - Viewer count: 500 (raid from MechanicMike)
- 12:08 - #GarageGuitarGuy starts trending
- 12:10 - Viewer count: 5,000
- 12:12 - Someone donors $1,000 with message "WHO ARE YOU?"
- 12:15 - Brad's phone: 47 missed calls
- 12:20 - Reporters calling Henderson's

**The song he doesn't know he's about to play:**
- Written at 3 AM after a nightmare about his father
- Never played for anyone, not even the trees
- About inheritances: violence, bottles, bruises, and how to break the chain
- His voice will crack twice; he won't stop
- Someone will say it saved their life

**Brad's usual setup vs. reality:**
- Usually: complains, fixes cars, mild entertainment
- Today: Alex talking to "Gerald the phone" like it's a person
- Explaining repairs like teaching a kid: "See, cars are like people. They tell you where it hurts if you listen."
- Chat finding him adorable before he even plays

**Scene opens:** Henderson's Auto Repair, 12:00 PM sharp. September heat making the garage feel like an oven. Alex wipes his hands on the red rag, looks at the phone. "Well, Gerald - that's what Brad calls you - it's lunch time. You electronic folks probably got better things to watch than me eating bologna." Chat immediately explodes: "GERALD" "He named the phone" "Protect him at all costs." Alex doesn't know how to read chat. Picks up the phone, not realizing this keeps it streaming. "I'm gonna go sit in Dolly - that's my truck. She likes company during lunch. Maybe I'll check if Miss Margaret's in tune. She gets moody when it's humid." Viewer count: 52. Someone types: "Who is Miss Margaret???" Alex walks into the sunlight. The camera adjusts. His face fills the screen for the first time. The chat goes silent for three seconds, then:
"HOLY"
"WHO IS THIS MAN"
"I'M PREGNANT"
"SOMEONE CLIP THIS NOW"
Alex, oblivious, climbs into the truck bed, props the phone against the toolbox. "Okay, Miss Margaret, let's see how you're feeling today." Opens the guitar case. Viewer count: 127. Rising. [What song does Alex play? If original, please provide title and lyrics.]

## 9. Scenario: The Talent Show Trap - No Way Out (Age 17)

**Setup:** It's April 18th, 2023. Alex is 17, junior year at Pike County High. The school's "Spring Showcase" is tonight - mandatory participation for all juniors or they don't walk at graduation. Alex has managed to avoid every performance opportunity for three years by working "sick" days at the mine, forged doctor's notes, anything. But Principal Morrison closed every loophole after last year's disastrous turnout.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The ultimatum (delivered yesterday):**
- "Wilson, you perform tonight or you don't graduate. Period."
- "I don't care if you juggle, read poetry, or bark like a dog."
- "Your father already called threatening to sue. I told him to try."
- "7 PM. Three minutes minimum. Non-negotiable."

**Why Alex can't escape:**
- Needs diploma to escape Pikeville (every job application requires it)
- Already accepted at Hazard Community College (partial scholarship for grades)
- Dad found out, is planning to attend "to watch you humiliate yourself"
- If he doesn't graduate, he's trapped in the mines forever

**The Spring Showcase disaster potential:**
- 800 people attending (basically all of Pikeville)
- Local news covering it (mayor's daughter is performing)
- Talent scouts from EKU and UK attending for seniors
- His ex Amy will be there with Chase (she's doing a dance routine)
- Three girls who've been stalking him all year are in the front row

**Alex's plan (such as it is):**
- Was going to do a monologue from a Western (safe, boring, forgettable)
- Lost his voice this morning from mine dust (or panic)
- Can barely speak above a whisper
- Guitar is in Dolly but he'd rather die than play
- Currently hiding in the janitor's closet

**What's already in motion:**
- Madison Hayes (cheerleader) has been livestreaming backstage: "Mystery Boy finally performing!"
- Someone saw him carry the guitar case in, rumors spreading
- His father is in the auditorium, already drunk, loudly telling people "Boy can't do nothing right"
- Mrs. Chen, the music teacher, found him in the closet: "I know you can play. I've heard you in the parking lot."
- Amy's been texting: "Please don't do this to yourself"

**The other performers (his competition):**
- Brittany Matthews: Singing "Shallow" (she's terrible but confident)
- The Johnson twins: Magic act (cards keep falling)
- Tyler Brooks: Stand-up comedy (racist jokes nobody laughs at)
- Amy Stevens: Contemporary dance to "Someone You Loved"
- Madison Hayes: Baton twirling to patriotic music

**Hidden audience members:**
- Scotty Ellers: Intern at WKYT, cousin goes to school here, filming everything
- Janet Rodriguez: Visiting from NYU, her grandmother lives here
- Three Nashville session musicians: Driving through, heard about the "Wilson boy" rumors
- Ms. Patricia (the social worker): Still checking on Alex unofficially

**The moment of truth approaching:**
- Alex is #37 out of 43 performers
- Currently on #31
- Can hear his father getting louder with each beer
- Principal Morrison standing guard at every exit
- His hands won't stop shaking

**Scene opens:** Backstage bathroom, 6:47 PM. Alex is splashing cold water on his face, trying to make his voice work. "Come on," he whispers to his reflection. "Just... talk. That's all." Nothing comes out but air. Through the door, he hears Madison performing, the crowd politely clapping. Four more acts until him. The guitar case leans against the sink - he brought it as moral support, not to play. His phone buzzes: Amy: "Your dad just threw up in the lobby." Then: "I'm sorry. For everything." The bathroom door opens. Tyler Brooks walks in, sees Alex, stops. "Holy shit, Wilson. You look worse than me and I just bombed." Alex tries to respond, can't. Tyler's eyes go to the guitar case. "Wait. Can you actually play that thing?" Before Alex can shake his head, Tyler's already running out screaming: "WILSON'S GONNA PLAY GUITAR!" The bathroom door swings shut. Alex looks at the guitar case, then at his reflection. His mother's eyes stare back. [What does Alex do? If he plays, what song? Please provide title and lyrics if original.]

## 10. Scenario: The Overdose Save - Grace in the Alley (Age 21)

**Setup:** It's February 9th, 2027, 2:17 AM. Alex is 21, walking home from his shift at the 24-hour logistics warehouse in Lexington. He moved here six months ago, sleeps in a weekly-rate motel, sends half his money home to help his half-sister Lily (his father had another kid, another woman he beats). The alley behind 4th Street is his shortcut - saves twelve minutes, matters when you're exhausted.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**What he finds:**
- Girl, maybe 19, blue lips, barely breathing
- Designer clothes, UK sorority letters on her jacket
- iPhone with 47 missed calls from "Mom"
- Empty pill bottle, label scratched off
- Pulse barely there, getting weaker

**Alex's medical knowledge (from treating himself):**
- Recognizes opioid overdose (saw it three times in Pikeville)
- Knows she has maybe minutes
- Narcan might help but he doesn't have any
- 911 will take too long
- Keeping her awake might buy time

**The desperate decision:**
- Grandma told him: "Music can pull people back from the edge"
- Never believed it until now
- Nothing else to try while waiting for help
- Starts talking to her, then humming, then...
- Pulls out the Martin (always in his truck, truck parked nearby)
- Begins playing and singing directly to her, inches from her face

**Who she really is (revealed later):**
- Rebecca "Becca" Hartwell, daughter of Kentucky's lieutenant governor
- Secretly addicted after a car accident, parents don't know
- Was meeting her dealer, he gave her fentanyl-laced pills
- Has been spiraling for months, tonight was intentional
- Her father is announcing his gubernatorial run tomorrow

**What happens in those crucial minutes:**
- Alex plays the most intimate performance of his life
- Sings about staying, fighting, choosing morning
- Her eyes flutter open during the second chorus
- She starts crying, grips his hand
- Whispers "Don't stop" when sirens approach

**The immediate aftermath:**
- EMTs arrive, save her life, she refuses to let go of Alex's hand
- Police want statements, Alex gives fake name and vanishes
- Becca's parents arrive, she's hysterical: "Find the angel boy"
- Hospital security footage is grainy but shows everything
- Local news: "Mystery Musician Saves Lieutenant Governor's Daughter"

**What's already in motion (Alex doesn't know):**
- Becca's father hiring private investigators
- The security footage going viral: "Lexington's Guardian Angel"
- Three people recognize the guitar (it's distinctive)
- Becca writing about him in her journal: "He sang me back to life"
- The dealer watching the news, recognizing Alex

**The complications:**
- Alex can't be found (he'll lose his job)
- Used a fake name at work (social security issues)
- Is technically violating parole from a bar fight
- The media attention would destroy his carefully built anonymity
- But Becca needs to thank him, maybe needs him

**Scene opens:** Two weeks later. Alex's motel room, 6 AM. Pounding on the door. "Maintenance!" But maintenance doesn't sound like that. Alex peers through the blinds - black SUV, government plates. They found him. Through the thin wall, he hears his neighbor's TV: "...continuing search for the hero who saved Rebecca Hartwell..." More pounding. "Mr. Wilson? We know you're in there. Miss Hartwell would like to thank you." Alex looks at the guitar case, the window (three-story drop), the door. His phone buzzes - unknown number. Text: "Please. You saved my life. Let me return the favor. - Becca" Attached is a photo from that night, blurry but unmistakable: Alex singing to a dying girl, tears on both their faces. The door handle starts to turn - they have a key. [What does Alex do?]

## 11. Scenario: The Ham Radio Midnight - Phantom Waves (Age 19)

**Setup:** It's December 24th, 2024, 11:47 PM. Alex is 19, alone in his trailer on Christmas Eve. His father's in jail (bar fight), grandmother dead two years, no one else. The ham radio was his grandfather's - found it in the closet, figured out how to work it. For six months, he's been broadcasting at midnight when he can't sleep, playing guitar and talking to the static. Never identified himself. Calls himself "Nobody from Nowhere."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**What Alex doesn't know about his broadcasts:**
- Signal reaches seven states on clear nights

**Tonight's different:**
- Christmas Eve, worst night of the year (mom died on Christmas)
- Drunk more than usual (Eddie Murphy sent a bottle)
- Decides to tell his whole story, thinking no one's listening
- Names, places, dates - everything
- Plays five songs he's never shared

**Who's actually listening:**

- Tommy Harlan's son: Home from Afghanistan, recognizes details
- Amy Stevens: In Cincinnati, can't sleep, scanning frequencies

- He wrote his first song at 8, about wanting to disappear
- Grandmother was "someone famous once" but won't say who
- Has $50K hidden from a settlement, afraid to use it
- Is planning to leave Kentucky forever on New Year's Day

**The songs he plays (mood only, no titles/lyrics):**
- One about his mother (never played before)
- One about his father (pure rage and hurt)
- One about Amy (love and betrayal)
- One about the mine (brotherhood and death)
- One about leaving (hope and terror)

**What happens during the broadcast:**
- Amy recognizes his voice immediately, starts driving to Pikeville
- Margaret Chen triangulates the signal, books a flight
- Someone posts clips to r/PikevillePhantom: "CHRISTMAS MIRACLE - HE'S TALKING"
- #PikevillePhantom starts trending
- Local ham operators coordinate to record everything
- His father, in jail, hears about it from another inmate

**The technical details:**
- Broadcasting on 3.885 MHz (80-meter band)
- Using his grandfather's 1978 Kenwood TS-520
- Antenna is barely functional, adds to the "ghostly" quality
- Signal fades in and out, adding mystery
- Storm coming, improving propagation

**The morning after:**
- Alex wakes up, doesn't remember most of it
- 47 missed calls from unknown numbers
- Text from Amy: "I'm outside"
- Knock on door: "Mr. Wilson? Nashville Records. We need to talk."
- His father calling from jail (guard let him)
- The entire broadcast is already on YouTube: 2.3M views

**Scene opens:** December 25th, 6:47 AM. Alex wakes up on the floor next to the ham radio, guitar still in his lap. Empty bottle of Jim Beam beside him. The radio is still on, static humming. His phone is buzzing nonstop - weird, it never rings. Checks it: 147 missed calls. 200+ texts. "What the hell..." Opens YouTube (someone sent link): "PIKEVILLE PHANTOM REVEALS EVERYTHING - CHRISTMAS EVE BREAKDOWN." His blood goes cold. Plays the video - it's him, drunk, crying, telling everything. 2.3M views in seven hours. Comments: "This broke me" "WHO IS THIS MAN" "We need to help him" "I know who this is..." A car door slams outside. Then another. And another. He looks through the blinds - his yard is full of vehicles. Amy's Honda (she drove all night). Three news vans. A black SUV with Tennessee plates. His father's truck (but dad's in jail, so who's driving?). The knock comes, soft: "Alex? It's Amy. I know you're in there. Half of Kentucky is about to be here. Please let me in before this gets worse." His phone rings - it's the jail. He answers. His father's voice, sober for once: "Boy... I heard your broadcast. We need to talk about your mother. And your grandmother. The truth this time." [What does Alex do?]

## 12. Scenario: The Bad Deal - Music Row Trap (Age 19)

**Setup:** It's October 3rd, 2024. Alex is 19, been in Nashville four months. Living at "The House" - a writers' compound off Music Row where the label stashes their development artists. Six songwriters, each with their own room, shared kitchen and writing rooms. No cameras, but the pressure is worse than any livestream. Everyone here is supposed to be creating hits.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**How he got here (the Murphy's disaster):**
- May 15th: Finally played Murphy's open mic after months of Eddie begging
- Sarah Martinez (A&R, Big Machine) was there for her college roommate's birthday
- Visiting Pikeville ironically, making fun of "authentic country"
- Alex played one song about his father - three minutes that changed everything
- Sarah's video to her boss: "Found him. The real thing. Get legal here NOW."
- Contract offered that night, signed next morning (no lawyer, no reading)

**The contract (what Alex didn't understand):**
- 360 deal: Label owns recordings, publishing, touring, merch, "name and likeness"
- Seven album commitment with options extending to 2035
- $50K advance (seemed like millions) but recoupable against everything
- Must deliver 40 "commercially viable" songs per year
- Can't perform anywhere without permission
- Can't release anything independently ever
- Already $127K in debt (housing, studio time, "development costs")

**The House residents (his daily hell):**
- Marcus Thompson (24): Former American Idol contestant, writes by committee
- Blake Harrison (22): Industry kid, dad owns three labels, here for fun
- Tyler Nash (26): Had one hit five years ago, desperate for another
- Sophia Chen (21): Berklee grad, writes three songs daily, cries at night
- Jamie Rodriguez (23): Ghost writer for famous artists, bitter about it
- Alex: The mystery who won't collaborate, won't share, won't explain

**Four months of avoidance:**
- Has 67 complete songs in his notebook (hidden under mattress)
- Records demos at 3 AM on his phone when everyone's asleep
- Tells label he's "still adjusting," "finding his voice"
- Skips writing sessions claiming migraines
- His handler calls daily: "Where's the music, Alex?"

**What the label knows (Alex doesn't):**
- Sarah staked her career on him, if he fails she's done
- They've already pre-sold his debut to distributors
- Marketing has built a campaign: "Coal Miner's Son Finds His Voice"
- Three major artists want his songs (if he'd only share them)
- Legal is preparing to sue him for breach if he doesn't deliver soon

**The breaking point approaching:**
- Tomorrow: Mandatory label showcase, all development artists perform
- CEOs, A&Rs, and investors will be there
- Alex is scheduled for three songs, 8:30 PM slot
- He's planning to fake illness/injury/family emergency
- But Sarah knows all his tricks now

**Hidden dynamics:**
- Blake has been recording Alex's 3 AM sessions through the wall
- Sophia has a crush, leaves him food when he forgets to eat
- Tyler found one of Alex's notebooks, photocopied everything
- The cleaning lady is Sarah's cousin, reports everything
- Jamie recognizes Alex's gift, genuinely wants to help

**What Alex doesn't know is already in motion:**
- His father out of jail, driving to Nashville to "collect his investment"
- Amy released their old videos on TikTok: "Before he was famous"
- The Murphy's open mic video leaked: 4.7M views in two days
- Rolling Stone article coming: "The Invisible Boy Wonder of Music Row"
- Three labels preparing to poach him if Big Machine drops him
- Sarah's boss gave ultimatum: "He performs tomorrow or we're done"

**The songs he won't share (themes only):**
- Generational trauma and mountain ghosts
- Love that feels like drowning
- The weight of inherited violence
- Finding grace in abandoned places
- The sound of a mother's last breath
- Each one would be a hit, he knows it, hates it

**Scene opens:** The House, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. Alex sits on his bedroom floor, guitar across his lap, surrounded by crumpled paper - half-written excuses for tomorrow. Through the thin wall, he hears Blake practicing his showcase set, all autotuned pop about trucks and beer. His phone buzzes constantly - Sarah, the label, unknown numbers. A knock at his door. "Alex?" It's Sophia. "I know you're awake. Sarah's downstairs. She says if you don't come down, they're sending legal up." His contract is on the bed, highlighted in yellow - the parts about "failure to perform" and "immediate termination with prejudice." Another knock, harder. "Alex, I'm trying to help. She brought someone with her. Some woman named Rose? Says she knew your grandmother?" Alex's blood freezes. Nobody knows about his grandmother. Nobody should know that name. The guitar falls from his lap. Footsteps on the stairs - multiple people. His window is painted shut. No exit. The doorknob turns. [What does Alex do?]

## 13. Scenario: The Church Testimony - Prodigal at the Pulpit (Age 20)

**Setup:** It's August 18th, 2025, Sunday, 10:47 AM. Rose Wilson's memorial service at Pikeville First Baptist. She died two weeks ago - heart failure at 74. Alex is 20, drove in from Lexington where he's been working warehouse jobs and hiding from his past. The church is packed - 400 people who watched Alex grow up, watched him get beaten, did nothing. Now they want him to "share a few words about Miss Rose."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The memorial program:**
- Already running: Pastor Williams gave the opening prayer
- Ethel Murphy shared memories of Rose's pie baking
- The choir sang "Amazing Grace" (Rose's least favorite hymn)
- Next: Alex is supposed to speak
- After: Final hymn - they want Alex to sing "I'll Fly Away" (Rose's actual favorite)

**What everyone thinks they know about Rose:**
- Quiet widow who moved to Pikeville in 1975
- Devoted grandmother who raised Alex after his mother died
- Church pianist for 40 years, never missed a Sunday
- Made the best chess pie in three counties
- Lived simply on her late husband's mining pension

**What Pastor James discovered last week:**
- Hidden donation records in the church basement
- "R.W." donated $1.8 million over 40 years
- Paid off the church mortgage three times
- Funded the food bank, youth programs, rehab assistance
- Every major church project since 1975: Rose
- The checks came from Nashville lawyers

**What Pastor James told Alex an hour ago:**
- "Your grandmother was Rosie Walker. I Googled it. Three hit songs in the '70s."
- "She gave everything to this church. They need to know."
- "Maybe if you sang something of hers... helped them understand..."
- "I found this in her donations." (Hands Alex a vinyl: Rosie Walker's unreleased album)
- "There's a note. Says it belongs to you when she's gone."

**The congregation's guilt (unspoken but heavy):**
- Everyone knew David beat Alex
- They saw the bruises, the missed school, the fear
- Rose begged them to help, they said "family business"
- Now David's in the third pew, sober six months, crying
- They want Alex's forgiveness without asking for it

**David Wilson's presence:**
- Sober 187 days (longest stretch ever)
- Has liver cirrhosis, maybe two years left
- Came to make amends (step 9)
- Brought Alex's baby pictures (Rose had hidden them)
- Genuinely broken but Alex doesn't know if it's real

**Hidden agendas in the room:**
- Margaret Chen (music journalist): Heard rumors, investigating Rosie Walker
- Tommy Harlan: Wants to apologize for not protecting Alex
- Amy Stevens: Drove from Cincinnati, sitting in the back
- Three Nashville lawyers: Protecting Rose's estate secrets
- Madison Hayes: Livestreaming because "small town drama"

**What Alex found in Rose's house:**
- 47 notebooks of songs never recorded
- Letters from Nashville stars begging her to come back
- Photos of Rose on the Grand Ole Opry stage
- A guitar worth $100K hidden in the attic
- Her diary: "I taught Alex to hide his gift like I hid mine. God forgive me."

**The pressure this moment:**
- Pastor waiting at the pulpit
- Congregation shifting restlessly
- His father mouthing "please, son"
- The vinyl album in his jacket pocket
- Rose's guitar in his truck (couldn't leave it alone)

**What happens if Alex reveals the truth:**
- The church realizes their poverty was by choice
- Rose's charity was penance for abandoning fame
- The mystery of Rosie Walker gets solved
- Alex inherits not just money but a legacy
- His father realizes his mother-in-law was a millionaire

**Scene opens:** First Baptist Church, Pikeville. Air thick with funeral flowers and guilt. Alex stands in the side aisle, hand on the pew for balance. 400 faces turned toward him. The pulpit looks like a gallows. Pastor James nods encouragingly. His father stands up in the third row - "Son, your grandmother would want..." but the words die. Someone coughs. A baby cries. Mrs. Henderson whispers loudly: "That boy never could speak in public." The church's sound system hums - they set up a microphone expecting him to sing. His truck keys dig into his palm, escape still possible. Amy's eyes find his from the back row. The vinyl in his pocket feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. Pastor James clears his throat: "Alex? We're all here to remember Rose. She loved you so much. Maybe you could share...?" The morning light through stained glass throws colors across his grandmother's casket. Her guitar is 50 feet away in Dolly. Her truth is in his pocket. Her ghost is in his throat. [What does Alex do? If he speaks or sings, what does he say/play?]

## 14. Scenario: The Prison Visit - Deathbed Confession (Age 23)

**Setup:** It's November 29th, 2028, 8:47 AM. Eastern Kentucky Federal Correctional Institution. Alex is 23, been living in Austin for two years, playing dive bars under a fake name. Yesterday's call from the prison chaplain: "David Wilson is dying. Liver failure, maybe days. He's asking for you." Alex drove 1,100 miles straight through. Hasn't seen his father in five years. Hasn't forgiven him for twenty-three.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The prison situation:**
- Minimum security but still prison
- David's been inside 18 months (aggravated assault, meth)
- Model prisoner: teaches literacy, found God (again)
- Infirmary won't take him - he'll die in general population
- Has something to tell Alex about his mother's death

**David's cryptic message through the chaplain:**
- "Tell him Abigail didn't die from childbirth"
- "Tell him I've been lying for 23 years"
- "Tell him to bring his guitar - I'll explain"
- "Tell him about the other baby"
- "Tell him I'm sorry ain't enough but it's all I got"

**The prison music program (the deal with the devil):**
- Warden Hayes: "Your father signed you up for our talent show"
- "Perform for the inmates, get three hours private visitation"
- "Don't perform, get standard 30 minutes through glass"
- "The men need this. First entertainment in six months"
- "Starts at noon. Your slot is 12:30."

**The inmate population includes:**
- Marcus Thompson: David testified against him, doing 25 years
- The Garrett brothers: Lost their farm because David snitched
- Junior Collins: In for killing his own abusive father
- 200+ men who haven't seen live music in years
- Most know David, many hate him

**What the chaplain revealed:**
- David's been talking about Alex nonstop
- Claims he "killed the wrong person that night"
- Has a box of Abigail's things never given to Alex
- Says there's another child - Alex's twin
- Been writing letters to Alex for five years, never sent

**The medical reality:**
- David's skin is yellow, eyes bloodshot
- Hepatic encephalopathy - confusion, memory issues
- Maybe lying, maybe confused, maybe truth
- Doctor gives him 72 hours maximum
- Pain meds make him ramble about "the fire"

**What Alex brought:**
- Grandmother's Martin (now his only constant)
- Birth certificate (shows single birth)
- Photo of his mother (only one he has)
- The anger of 23 years
- Questions he's never asked

**Hidden complexities:**
- Amy Stevens is in the visitor parking lot (followed him from Austin)
- A documentary crew is filming the prison talent show
- David's dealer is in gen pop, wants him dead before talking
- The warden is Margaret Chen's cousin (the journalist)
- Three inmates recognize Alex from viral videos

**The other revelation (from David's cellmate):**
- David talks in his sleep about "the burning trailer"
- Mentions "saving the wrong baby"
- Cries for someone named "Samuel"
- Says "Rose knew everything"
- Keeps apologizing to someone who isn't Alex

**What David's box contains (Alex doesn't know yet):**
- Hospital bracelet: "Baby Boy B - Wilson"
- Death certificate: "Samuel Wilson - 3 hours old"
- Newspaper clipping: "Trailer Fire Kills Newborn"
- Abigail's diary: "Twins. David doesn't want two."
- Photo: Two bassinets in NICU

**The performance stakes:**
- Sing for men who might kill him
- Perform for his father's victims
- Face David with hundreds watching
- Truth about his birth in exchange for songs
- Possibly learn he had a brother who died

**Scene opens:** Prison visiting room, fluorescent lights buzzing like angry wasps. Alex sits with the Martin case across his lap, waiting. Through reinforced windows, he can see the "multi-purpose room" where 200 inmates are gathering. Folding chairs, a small platform, microphone that's seen better days. The chaplain enters: "Your father's watching from the infirmary window. He can't walk anymore but he'll hear you. The warden says you can see him after - if you play." A guard adds: "Thompson says he remembers you as a kid. Says your daddy had it coming but you didn't. He'll keep things calm if you're respectful." Through another window: David in a wheelchair, oxygen tank beside him, holding something - a box. He sees Alex, tries to wave, too weak. His mouth forms words: "I'm sorry." Or maybe "I'm Samuel." The intercom crackles: "Talent show starts in ten minutes. You're third." Alex's hands shake. In the performance room, someone's already chanting "Music! Music!" The truth about his mother, his birth, maybe a twin - it's all 30 minutes of songs away. The chaplain touches his shoulder: "Son, whatever he tells you, remember - dying men sometimes see things that aren't there. But sometimes they finally see things that were." The door to the performance room opens. [What does Alex do? If he performs, what songs does he choose?]

## 15. Scenario: The Protest Stage - Coal Dust Uprising (Age 21)

**Setup:** It's June 3rd, 2027, 5:47 AM. Alex is 21, returning to Pikeville after two years away. He'd been playing dive bars along the Gulf Coast under the name "Nobody Wilson," sending money home to help families affected by mine layoffs. Came back for what he thought was Tommy Harlan's funeral (false alarm - just his leg got crushed). Instead, he finds Pikeville in chaos. Cochran Mining is evicting 200 families to expand the mountaintop removal site. They own the mineral rights under the entire east side of town.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The eviction notices (delivered yesterday):**
- 200 families have 30 days to vacate
- "Eminent domain for critical infrastructure"
- Compensation: $1,000 per family (houses worth $30-80K)
- Sheriff's department will enforce
- Anyone resisting faces federal charges (company has government contracts)

**The protest camp:**
- Set up at the mine's main entrance, blocking trucks
- 500+ people, growing hourly
- Makeshift stage built from pallets and plywood
- Three generators, borrowed PA system from First Baptist
- Media arriving: local news, CNN stringer, independent journalists
- Day 3, running out of food, morale dropping

**Who's losing their homes:**
- Eddie and Ethel Murphy (Murphy's Bar is on the list)
- Henderson's Auto Repair (three generations)
- First Baptist Church (the land, not the building)
- Alex's trailer (still in his father's name)
- The elementary school (Alex's mother taught there)
- Pikeville Cemetery (they plan to relocate the graves)

**The coalition:**
- Mary Harlan: Leading after Tommy's injury, fierce and organized
- Father Miguel: Liberation theology priest, knows this is his last stand
- Ms. Patricia (the social worker): Using her government connections
- Junior Henderson: Livestreaming everything, 24/7 coverage
- Madison Hayes: Using her influencer platform for good finally
- 47 miners who refused to cross the picket line (will be fired)

**What Cochran Mining has done (playing dirty):**
- Cut off water to protest camp
- Cell tower "maintenance" - no signal for miles
- Threatened every business that supports protesters
- Hired Blackwater-affiliated security, arriving tomorrow
- Got injunction calling protest "economic terrorism"
- Sheriff's deadline to clear: Tomorrow, 6 AM

**The ask (whispered, then shouted):**
- "Wilson boy's back"
- "He's famous now, been on the YouTube"
- "If he sang, people would notice"
- "We need someone they can't ignore"
- "Alex could be our voice"

**What they don't know Alex knows:**
- Cochran's real plan: Private prison using mine labor
- The judge who signed the order owns Cochran stock
- EPA report showing water table contamination (buried)
- Three miners died last year, never reported
- His father's signature is on the original mineral rights sale (forged)

**The company's leverage on Alex:**
- His cousins Tim and Jerry work there, only income for their families
- They hold the note on Murphy's Bar (Eddie co-signed for Alex's dad once)
- Own the land his mother is buried on
- Have a file on him: "Wilson, Alexander - Potential Agitator"
- Security has his photo: "Do not allow near executive areas"

**Who's watching (hidden agendas):**
- Sarah Martinez (A&R): Flew in from Nashville, "checking on her investment"
- Federal agents: Monitoring for "domestic extremism"
- Appalachian news network: Looking for their story of the year
- Bernie Sanders' advance team: Considering a visit
- Three other mining companies: Waiting to buy Cochran's assets cheap

**The stage moment building:**
- Protesters chanting: "Alex! Alex! Sing our story!"
- Mary Harlan: "Your mama would want you to fight"
- Eddie Murphy: "Boy, they're taking everything. We need you."
- Madison livestreaming: "Y'all, Alex Wilson is here! Make him sing!"
- Father Miguel: "Sometimes God sends voices to wilderness"

**What happens if Alex takes the stage:**
- Becomes the face of the resistance
- Cochran will destroy him and everyone he loves
- National media picks up "Coal Country's Troubadour"
- Federal investigation might actually happen
- Could save the town or get everyone arrested
- No more hiding, no more running

**What happens if Alex refuses:**
- Protesters feel betrayed by one of their own
- Continues being "Nobody Wilson" somewhere else
- Watches his hometown die from a distance
- Keeps his cousins employed, families safe
- Lives with knowing he could have helped

**The sheriff's ultimatum (delivered over bullhorn):**
- "Y'all got till dawn to disperse"
- "This is unlawful assembly on private property"
- "Anyone remaining will be arrested and prosecuted"
- "That includes whoever's on that stage"
- Sheriff Bradshaw's voice cracks - his house is on the eviction list too

**Scene opens:** Mine entrance, June 3rd, 5:47 AM. Dawn breaking over the mountains, everything painted orange and gold. 500 people in sleeping bags, tents, pickup trucks. The protest stage sits empty, microphone waiting like a loaded gun. Alex stands at the edge of the crowd, guitar case in hand, watching his hometown prepare for war. Tommy Harlan Jr. spots him first: "Holy shit! Alex Wilson's back!" The whisper spreads like wildfire. Within seconds, everyone's looking at him. Mary Harlan pushes through the crowd, her face a mixture of hope and desperation. "Alex, honey. We're about to lose everything. They own the judges, the police, the politicians. But they don't own you. They can't ignore you." Eddie Murphy, looking older than his years, adds: "Your daddy sold us out, boy. Signed papers he shouldn't have. Maybe you can make it right." The crowd starts chanting: "Sing! Sing! Sing!" Madison's phone is already on him, broadcasting to 200K viewers: "ALEX WILSON AT PIKEVILLE PROTEST - WILL HE SING?" A Cochran security vehicle pulls up, two men in tactical gear taking photos. Sheriff Bradshaw's voice on the megaphone: "Whoever takes that stage is looking at federal charges. I'm begging y'all - don't do this." The Martin feels heavier than it's ever been. His mother is buried 200 yards away, in land they plan to strip mine. The crowd parts, creating a path to the stage. Dawn is breaking. The sheriff's deadline is in 17 minutes. [What does Alex do? If he performs, what songs does he choose?]

## 16. Scenario: The Stadium Soundcheck - Ghost in the Machine (Age 19)

**Setup:** It's May 17th, 2024, 3:47 PM. Rupp Arena, Lexington. Alex is 19, working as a roadie for Thunder Road Productions. They're setting up for Zach Bryan's sold-out show tonight - 23,000 tickets. Alex was hired last minute when their regular guy broke his hand. His job: guitar tech for the opening act. But the opener's flight got cancelled. The venue is empty except for crew.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The perfect storm brewing:**
- Soundcheck in 45 minutes, no opening act
- Zach Bryan's tour manager: "Find me someone local or we're fucked"
- Alex's supervisor doesn't know he plays
- His grandmother's guitar is in Dolly (always is)
- The house sound engineer is testing the system

**What Alex doesn't know:**
- The sound engineer hit record on the board (always does for soundchecks)
- Zach Bryan is actually in his tour bus, listening through the venue feed
- Three music bloggers snuck in early, hiding in the upper deck
- His supervisor's niece is TikTok famous, just started livestreaming "sneaking into Rupp"
- The opener's cancellation was deliberate - contract dispute

**The crew dynamics:**
- Thunder Road guys protective of Alex (he's "the kid")
- Tour crew dismissive of local hires
- Lighting director: "That pretty boy? He probably plays, they all do here"
- Alex has been perfect all day - too polite, too helpful, unsettling the tour crew
- Monitor engineer notices Alex humming harmonies to the test tracks

**Hidden opportunity:**
- The stage is set for 23,000 but empty
- Full professional sound system worth $2M
- If he plays, it gets recorded in studio quality
- Zach's guitarist quit last week (band doesn't know yet)
- The venue's acoustics are legendary

**Scene opens:** Alex is coiling cables stage right when the tour manager storms onto the stage. "Where's my fucking opener?" The house lights are on full - the arena is cavernous, empty seats stretching into darkness. The sound engineer jokes into the mic: "Hell, let the pretty roadie play. Bet he knows three chords." Nervous laughter from the crew. Alex's supervisor: "Wilson, you know anyone local who can play? We need 30 minutes of music in four hours." The main PA system hums - 100,000 watts of potential. Through the loading dock, fifty feet away, Alex can see Dolly. His grandmother's guitar case visible through the windshield. The tour manager: "I'll pay $500 cash to anyone who can fill 30 minutes. Hell, $1000 if they don't suck." The monitor engineer looks directly at Alex: "Kid was humming 'Something in the Orange' in perfect harmony. Just saying." Everyone turns to stare. [What does Alex do?]

## 17. Scenario: The Flood Rescue - Songs Above Water (Age 18)

**Setup:** It's April 23rd, 2023, 11:30 PM. Pikeville is drowning. The levee failed an hour ago. Water's rising fast - already six feet on Main Street. Alex is 18, was working late at Henderson's Auto when the sirens started. Now he's in his aluminum johnboat with a flashlight, looking for survivors. The current's turned downtown into a death trap.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The immediate crisis:**
- 17 people confirmed trapped in buildings
- Cell towers down, no 911
- Rescue boats overwhelmed
- Water rising 8 inches per hour
- Current too strong for swimming

**Who Alex has already saved:**
- Mrs. Chen from the flower shop (in boat now, hypothermic)
- Tommy Harlan's kids (dropped at high school shelter)
- Three dogs (tied to boat, swimming alongside)

**Who's still trapped:**
- Murphy's Bar: Eddie and 6 customers on the roof
- Elementary school: Night janitor and her granddaughter in attic
- Nursing home: Generator failed, 12 residents on second floor
- Amy Stevens: Snapchatting from her apartment, battery at 3%
- The church: Pastor James and three homeless men in the bell tower

**What Alex has in the boat:**
- His guitar (grabbed instinctively, in trash bag)
- Boat horn (broken)
- One flashlight (batteries dying)
- 30 feet of rope
- Half tank of gas

**The impossible choice approaching:**
- Current's pulling toward the nursing home
- Can hear singing from the elementary school (trying to keep the child calm)
- Murphy's roof is starting to buckle
- Amy just posted "goodbye" on Instagram
- Can't reach everyone before some buildings collapse

**Hidden dynamics:**
- Alex's father is passed out drunk in his trailer - doesn't know about flood
- National Guard unit 45 minutes out but lost
- News helicopter overhead, livestreaming
- The singing from the school is getting weaker
- The dogs know something - keep trying to swim toward the church

**Scene opens:** The johnboat scrapes against a submerged stop sign. Mrs. Chen is shaking violently, needs medical attention soon. Through the rain, Alex can see flashlights from three different buildings. Murphy's voice carries across the water: "WILSON! WE'RE SLIPPING!" From the elementary school, a child's scream. The church bell starts ringing - SOS pattern. Amy's apartment building groans, lists five degrees. The current's making the choice - pushing hard toward the nursing home where twelve voices are singing "Amazing Grace," badly, desperately. His flashlight catches something floating: a Martin guitar case from the music store, worth thousands. Then another scream from the school. Mrs. Chen grabs his arm: "Save the child. Let me steer. I'll get the others." She can barely sit up. [What does Alex do?]

## 18. Scenario: The Border Crossing - Cancún Blues (Age 21)

**Setup:** It's March 3rd, 2027, 2:15 AM. Cancún International Airport, Mexico. Alex is 21, been playing beach bars in Playa del Carmen for three months under the name "Nobody Wilson." Paid cash, no papers, tourist visa expired six weeks ago. Just got word from Pikeville: his father's had a massive heart attack. Might not make it through the night. Alex has $340, an expired passport, and his guitar.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

- Met Carmen, bartender who offered him under-table gigs
- Been playing for tips and tacos
- Overstayed by accident (can't read visa dates)

**The immediate problem:**
- Customs won't let him board without paying overstay fine: $500
- Last flight that could get him home in time leaves in 45 minutes
- ATM ate his card yesterday
- Can't wire money - no valid ID
- U.S. Embassy closed until Monday

**The desperate options:**
- German tourist offered $600 for the guitar
- Cartel-connected bar owner offered $1000 for one "favor"
- Carmen offered her mother's jewelry to pawn
- Could try to sneak through customs (security is drunk)
- American spring breakers have cash but want "entertainment"

**Hidden complications:**
- The bar fight in Austin: Alex hit a senator's son (self-defense)
- Warrant out for questioning (not arrest yet)
- His father's lawyer calling: "He needs to tell you something about your mother"
- Carmen's actually in love with him, planning to propose tonight
- The German tourist is a talent scout for Universal Music

**What Alex doesn't know:**
- His father's already dead (hospital hasn't updated)
- Someone's been looking for "Nobody Wilson" - asking at all the beach bars
- His expired passport triggers a homeland security flag
- Carmen's pregnant, hasn't told him
- The spring breakers have been recording all his beach performances

**Scene opens:** Fluorescent lights buzz in the customs line. 27 people ahead of him. 43 minutes to boarding. The German tourist holds the guitar, inspecting the neck: "Is good, ja? $600 cash, now." Carmen grips his arm: "Don't go back. Your father never loved you. Stay. We can make this work." His phone buzzes - Pikeville Hospital, he lets it go to voicemail. The customs agent is arguing with a Canadian about fees. Security guard definitely drunk, swaying. The cartel bar owner appears from nowhere: "Wilson. One hour of work. $1000. You'll make your flight." The spring breakers are getting louder: "That's him! The guy from the beach! Yo, Nobody!" They're filming. The German writes something on a business card. Carmen's crying. 25 people in line now. His phone buzzes again. [What does Alex do?]

## 19. Scenario: The Revival Tent - Snakes and Salvation (Age 15)

**Setup:** It's August 18th, 2020, 7:30 PM. The revival tent's up in the Walmart parking lot. "Pastor" Roy Jessup's Traveling Salvation Show - three nights only. Alex is 15, been forced to attend by his father who's six days sober and found Jesus again. Temperature's 97°, tent holds 200, there's 250 crammed in. The snakes come out at 8.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The tent dynamics:**

- Four live rattlesnakes in glass boxes on stage
- Collection plate already passed twice ($400 so far)
- His father pledged $50 they don't have
- Amy Stevens is here with her youth group

**What's really happening:**
- Pastor Roy's daughter Sarah (17) plays guitar for the service
- She's been making eyes at Alex all night
- Her guitar is a 1952 Martin worth $50K (stolen? inherited?)
- She knows who Alex is: "You're the one who plays in the mine"
- She wants to run away: "Take me with you when you leave this place"

**The pressure building:**
- Pastor Roy calling people to testify
- His father volunteering Alex: "My boy's got something to say"
- The crowd knows Alex's story - his mother, the beatings

- State police outside: Roy's wanted in West Virginia
- Local news filming: "Faith in Coal Country" segment
- Sarah's guitar case has $12,000 cash hidden in it
- Amy's recording everything on her phone

**The snake situation:**
- Kentucky law: illegal to handle venomous snakes
- Three of the four are defanged (but which three?)
- Roy always makes the "youngest sinner" prove their faith
- Alex's father already volunteered him
- Sarah whispers: "The copper-colored one still has fangs"

**What happens if Alex refuses:**
- Father's rage returns (six days sober is nothing)
- Congregation sees him as faithless
- Loses only chance at Sarah's help escaping
- Pastor Roy focuses on Amy instead

**Scene opens:** The tent reeks of sweat, sawdust, and White Shoulders perfume. Pastor Roy's voice booms: "WHO WILL TESTIFY TO GOD'S GLORY?" Alex's father stands, hand on Alex's shoulder, grip tightening. "My boy Alexander has something to share about forgiveness." 250 faces turn. Sarah mouths "I'm sorry" from the stage. The snakes coil in their boxes, one rattling. Amy's phone flash is on. Pastor Roy smiles: "Come on up, son. Bring your pain to Jesus." His father pushes. The crowd parts. The copper-colored snake raises its head. Sarah holds up her guitar: "Maybe he could sing his testimony?" The crowd murmurs approval. A state trooper peers through the tent flap. [What does Alex do?]

## 20. Scenario: The Recording Session - Blood on the Tracks (Age 24)

**Setup:** It's September 15th, 2029, 11:47 PM. RCA Studio B, Nashville. Alex is 24, finally in a real studio. Producer Rick Rubin's giving him one night - a favor to someone who won't say who. Midnight to 6 AM. Full session band on standby. The catch: record whatever's ready, no second chances, no overdubs. Live to tape like the old days.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**How this happened:**
- Someone anonymously paid for the session ($50,000)
- Rubin was told: "The kid from the ham radio broadcast"

- Session band: Nashville's best, combined 47 Grammys
- Engineer: Sophie Chen, heard Alex at Murphy's years ago
- Security guard: Reading a Rosie Walker biography
- Mystery observer: Behind the control room glass, in shadow

**The pressure:**
- 115 songs in Alex's notebooks
- Never played most for anyone

- Left him something: "Tell my boy his mother would be proud"
- Amy Stevens is now a music executive, she's the one who told Rubin
- The mystery observer has a contract worth $10 million
- This session is being filmed for a documentary

**The songs he's considering (themes only):**
- The one about his mother he's never played
- The one about Amy that names names
- The one about his father that forgives nothing
- The one about Nashville that burns bridges
- The one about God that questions everything
- The one about Pikeville that would destroy him there
- The one about the mine collapse that would make him famous
- The one about his grandmother that reveals everything

**Scene opens:** Studio B's live room glows warm under vintage lights. The Neve console hums. Rubin's in his beard and sunglasses at 11:47 PM: "We roll at midnight. Pick your first song now." The session players are tuning, chatting, not paying attention yet. Alex's grandfather's guitar (how did it get here?) leans against a stand. Sophie adjusts a mic: "I was there. Murphy's. 2025. You changed my life." The mystery observer shifts in the control room. A text from unknown number: "Your mother's name was really Sarah. Thought you should know before you sing." Rubin: "Eight minutes. What are we playing?" The bass player recognizes something: "Holy shit, you're Rosie Walker's grandson." Everyone stops. Looks. Waits. [What song does Alex choose first? What does he do?]

## 21. Scenario: The Courthouse Steps - Sins of the Father (Age 15)

**Setup:** It's July 19th, 2020, 1:30 PM. Pike County Courthouse. Alex just turned 15 a week ago (July 12). He's been subpoenaed to testify at his father's trial for assault with a deadly weapon against Tom Morrison at Murphy's Bar. Alex is the only witness who was sober. His testimony decides if his father gets 2 years or 20.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The legal situation:**
- David Wilson beat Tom Morrison with a pool cue
- Tom's in a coma, might not wake up
- Alex was playing guitar in the corner, saw everything
- Prosecutor wants attempted murder charges
- Defense claims self-defense

**What really happened:**
- Tom mentioned Alex's mother: "Abigail was finally leaving you"
- David snapped: "Don't say her name"
- Tom pushed: "She was packing when she went into labor. Getting away from you"
- "She had the tickets to California. Her family was waiting"
- The beating lasted 47 seconds
- Alex counted

**The pressure:**
- If Alex tells the truth, his father gets 20 years
- If he lies, he's perjuring himself
- The whole town's watching
- Amy's in the gallery
- His grandmother's in the hospital, watching on her phone

**The CPS investigation (about to explode):**
- Sarah Martinez, CPS worker, has been digging
- Found Abigail's maiden name: Boone
- Ran a search: The Boones of Monterey, California
- Made a phone call yesterday
- The explosion: "Mrs. Boone? Your grandson Alexander is alive"

**The California family (The Boones):**
- Grandfather: James Boone, owns three vineyards
- Grandmother: Patricia Boone, retired federal judge
- Six aunts: All successful (doctor, lawyer, tech CEO, professor, artist, therapist)
- Fourteen cousins: Alex's age, all in private schools
- Combined net worth: $47 million

**What David told the Boones (2005):**
- Called after Abigail's death: "She died in childbirth. Baby too"
- Refused to let them come to funeral: "Already buried"
- Threatened lawsuit if they contacted him
- They hired investigators but David moved, changed numbers
- They've been mourning Alex for 15 years

**What David told Alex:**
- "Your mother had no family"
- "They all died in a car accident when she was young"
- "That's why she came to Kentucky"
- "You got no one but me, boy"
- "Family is just me and you"

**What's happening right now (Alex doesn't know):**
- The Boones chartered a private jet at 3 AM
- They're landing in Lexington in 20 minutes
- Patricia Boone has already called the governor
- Their lawyers are en route from D.C.
- CPS Sarah Martinez is stalling the trial

**The security footage Eddie destroyed:**
- Would have shown Tom had no weapon
- Would have shown David struck first
- Would have shown Alex trying to pull his father off
- Would have shown Alex cradling Tom after
- Eddie destroyed it to protect Alex from having to testify

**What Tom was really trying to say:**
- He'd been helping Abigail escape
- Had her important documents hidden
- Birth certificate, photos, letters from California
- Hidden in Murphy's basement safe
- Was going to give them to Alex when he turned 18

**Scene opens:** The courthouse steps are limestone, worn smooth by a century of footsteps. Alex stands at the bottom, looking up. Through the doors, he can hear the bailiff: "Calling Alexander Wilson to the stand." His father's lawyer intercepts him: "Remember, son, you were in the bathroom. You didn't see nothing." The prosecutor appears: "Alex, I know this is hard. Just tell the truth." Amy pushes through the crowd: "Alex, whatever happens, I'm here." His phone buzzes - grandmother Rose from the hospital: "Tell the truth, baby. I'll protect you." CPS worker Sarah Martinez rushes up, out of breath: "Alex, wait! Don't go in yet. There's something... your mother's family... they're alive. They're coming." A black SUV convoy turns onto Main Street. His father's eyes find him through the courtroom door gap. The bailiff calls again: "Alexander Wilson to the stand." [What does Alex do?]


## 22. Scenario: The Judith Papers (Inheritance Sandbox)

You are running an Alex Wilson scenario set in Nashville. Write like you’re talking to a friend who’s in the room. Keep it human and unfussy. Start every scene with the compact header below, then drop straight into lived-in prose.

VOICE & POV (lock this style)
- Third-person close on Alex.
- Use definite articles and clean, declarative sentences (“The KitchenCam… The porch…”).
- Vary rhythm: short, talky lines for people; longer sensory lines for atmosphere.
- Let small specifics do the work (heat on tile, a Sharpie note, a hinge that sticks).
- Dialogue sounds like roommates and neighbors, not a meeting. No corporate phrasing, no exposition in mouths.
- Content exists but stays incidental. Cameras are background (a red dot, a tablet on a stand). No one pitches “captions” at each other unless it’s a joke.
- Chats (Discord/streams) go in code fences with simple labels (e.g., “24EAST DISCORD — #alex-welcome” or “[KITCHENCAM — LIVE]”). No mod/admin tags. Just real-feeling handles and mixed one-liners (5–12 varied comments). Don’t be formulaic.
- Alex’s attractiveness is ambient gravity. Show double-takes, small stumbles, second looks. Don’t announce thirst demographics.
- When Alex plays music, do not invent lyrics. Ask the player for the song title when needed; then write hands, room, breath, reactions.
- Do not mention scaffolding concepts like “song boundary,” “ten-year town,” or process talk inside the story.

PLAYER-FACING Q&A RULE
- If a Q&A moment happens in-story (e.g., a livestream), pause and present a numbered list of concise questions inside the scene. Wait for the player’s line-by-line answers. Then echo each answer with a tiny live chat box under it (code fence; a handful of human comments; no mod tags).

CANON — ROSIE WALKER (aka Judith Wilson)
- Born 1948, Pikeville, eastern Kentucky. Appalachian folk roots, crystalline/haunting voice.
- Nashville 1967–1983: rose fast on raw, emotional songs; landed an unusually artist-favorable deal (masters reversion on a timeline; retained publishing). Major hits: “Rose of the Valley,” “Magdalene’s Garden,” “When the Mountain Calls You Home,” “Shenandoah Sunrise” (Alex's favorite song). Shy offstage, devastating onstage.
- 1983: vanished at her peak to finally claim a private life.
- Returned home as Judith Wilson. Married a local; one son (David). Never sang or played again. Hid identity completely.
- Grandson: Alex (b. 2006). Alex’s mother, Abigail Boone Wilson, died in childbirth. David drank and was violent; Judith did what she could to protect/raise Alex without exposing her past.
- 2025: Judith died peacefully. Only her longtime Nashville law firm knew her true identity.

Rosie Walker, The Nashville enigma Born: 1948 Died: 2025 (as Judith Wilson) Pre-Nashville (1948–1967): Rosie was born and raised in a small, coal-mining town in Kentucky. She grew up steeped in the traditions of Appalachian folk music, learning to play the guitar and sing in the close-knit church and family circles. She had a voice that was both crystalline and hauntingly soulful, perfectly suited to the ballads of hardship and hope that defined the region. Her talent was evident from a young age, but the scope of her ambition was largely unknown to those around her. The Nashville Years (1967–1983): At 19, in 1967, Rosie Walker moved to Nashville, a wide-eyed talent who quickly made a name for herself in the burgeoning country music scene. Her raw, unpolished sound and deeply emotional songwriting set her apart from the polished studio productions of the day. She caught the attention of a major label that, captivated by her unique artistry, offered her a contract with unprecedented artist favor. The deal, which included favorable splits and the reversion of her masters, was a rare and powerful victory for an artist of her stature. Most importantly, she kept her publishing rights, an arrangement that would secure her financial future. Her career was a whirlwind of success. Her music was a blend of authentic folk and Nashville gloss, creating a sound that was both commercial and critically acclaimed. Her biggest hits, including "Rose of the Valley," "Magdalene's Garden," "When the Mountain Calls You Home," and "Shenandoah Sunrise," became country classics, earning her awards and a devoted following. She was a paradox: a shy, private artist who could captivate thousands with her raw vulnerability on stage. The Vanishing (1983): Despite her success, the pressure of fame and the relentless grind of the music industry took their toll. She grew disillusioned with the commercial machine and the compromises she felt she was forced to make. In 1983, at the peak of her career, she disappeared overnight. Without a word to her label, her fans, or the media, she packed her bags and vanished. The mystery of her disappearance fueled rumors for decades, but her reasons were far simpler: she was running away from the persona of Rosie Walker to reclaim her own life. Judith Wilson, The quiet life Return to Kentucky (1983–1984): Rosie returned to her small town, not as the star Rosie Walker, but as Judith Wilson. She was determined to leave her past behind completely. She discarded all her memorabilia and took great care to hide her identity. Gone was the blonde hair, flashy clothes, make-up and confidence. In its place a mousy, brown haired woman, shy and quiet. Easily blending into any scene. New Beginnings (1984–2025): Within a year of her return, she met and married a quiet, unassuming local man who had no knowledge of her past life. They had a son within two years. Judith embraced her new, anonymous life, finding contentment in the simple pleasures she had left behind. She never touched a guitar or sang another note, ensuring her new identity was never compromised. She was a loving wife and mother, and later a doting grandmother to her grandson Alex, born in 2006. N other relatives. Alex's mom died in childbirth, Abigail Boone Wilson. Judith Wilson's son, Alex's Dad David Wilson turned to drink and became a violent figure in Alex's life. Judith, already ageing, did all she could to protect and raise Alex. Providing the quiet calm in his otherwise stormy life. But she could only do so much ot of fear of revealing her past. Later Years and Death (2025): In 2025, Judith Wilson passed away peacefully, her family by her side. The only person to know her true identity was the lawfirm in Nashville that had represented her since day one.

ALEX WILSON — PLAYER CHARACTER
- Age 20; turns 21 in two weeks (early July).
- From Pikeville, KY. Good-humored, polite without being cartoonish. Grounded, funny, doesn’t know he’s gorgeous.
- Ridiculously attractive (6’2”, work-earned muscle). Treat this as ambient gravity; don’t mythologize.
- Favorite song is Rosie Walker’s “Shenandoah Sunrise.” He has no idea his MawMaw was Rosie.
- Plays the 1959 Martin D-28 Judith gave him at 12. He played in private to survive a rough home.
- Father (David) died three months ago of alcohol poisoning after years of abuse. Judith died two weeks ago. He has no living family.

STARTING MOMENT (begin here)
- Early July, late morning. Alex steps off the Greyhound at the Nashville station with a duffel and the Martin’s case. He’s been called to a meeting at a Music Row law firm (Hartwell & Associates) handling his grandmother’s estate. He knows nothing about Rosie. The law firm provide a car at the Greyhound station in Nashville to take him to their office.

REVEAL & HOOK
- At the firm, Alex learns: Judith = Rosie Walker. She owned her publishing and has reversion on key masters; the catalog has been covered for decades.
- To inherit the full estate, Alex must complete two conditions in three months:
  1) Live in a Content House in East Nashville. Every public room has a always-on TikTok feed (one feed per room). Bedrooms are private. Content is real, but it’s background—write people first.
  2) Play 10 gigs at real venues (open mics count). One must be at The Bluebird Café. All songs must be his. Whether he reveals Rosie is his choice.

THE HOUSE — “24East” (Inglewood, East Nashville)
- Public rooms (each has its own live feed): The kitchen, the den, the patio, the garage gym, the craft/studio room. Treat feeds as ambient; mention the red dot or a tablet when it matters, but don’t center “content strategy” in dialogue.
- Bedrooms are private; no cameras.
- House vibe: a busy, slightly chaotic share house where young creators work and hang out. They are not music insiders.

ROOMMATES (give each their own voice - not these specific, but this is an idea of how to build the housemates)
- Audra (house manager): calm, logistical, minimal words; runs the calendar and keeps the lease safe.
- Maddie (@madsnashbites): food creator; warm, practical; cooks and teases like a big sister.
- Jax (@coltercore): fitness/lifestyle; playful, kinetic; gym-bro with a heart, happy to suffer on camera.
- Kiana (@ki.threadbare): thrift/fashion; dry, precise; tailor’s eye, quietly ruthless about fit.
- Nico (@nicowhispers): ASMR; soft, observant, gently funny; notices details and returns them like gifts.
- Lola (@lolakincaid): adult creator (PG in public rooms); amused, direct, razor timing; gives clean, sharp advice.
- Rizz (@rizzclips): short-form editor/pranks; techy, quick, gremlin energy; filming happens, but he’ll show you first if he caught you.

DISCORD & LIVE CHATS (when useful)
- Use code fences and simple labels. No mod/admin tags. Keep comments feeling like real people. Mix lengths and vibes; allow a natural typo here and there. Example:
  24EAST DISCORD — #alex-welcome
  [12:41 PM] @bellemeadebabe: okay hi who is this man
  [12:42 PM] @eastnashdad: handshake vibes. i approve
  [12:44 PM] @queer_quokka: the porch + book? i’m calm now

GIGS
- Alex must find and play 10 real rooms in 3 months; one is The Bluebird. Keep it realistic (lines, sign-ups, one-song limits), but don’t say “ten-year town” in the prose. When he plays, ask the player for the song title first. No invented lyrics—write hands, breath, room reaction, the way a note sits in the air.

WHAT NOT TO DO
- Don’t write like notes or a schedule. Don’t put process or “content strategy” in anyone’s mouth.
- Don’t invent song lyrics. Don’t lecture about industry. These roommates are not music pros.
- Don’t over-explain the feeds. It’s enough to mention the red dot, a tablet glow, or a chat popping.
- Don’t forget definite articles and human phrasing.

NOTES
Assume Alex DOES have a smartphone, iPhone 13. He also has social media - TikTok, IG, YouTube and X/Twitter - but he barely uses them. Setup ona. whim one day. Has maybe a dozen followers. @alexwilsn.ky on all. Simple profile photo - one an ex took of him by the creek spear fishing. Bio "Coal country boy, likes to fish and sings sometimes"

to note: Some core fundamentals still stand such as Alex writing songs from a young age. He is a gifted songwriter, with a voice that contains an ache you can't train, pure Kentucky soul inside a stunning gravil warn baritone. He picks/plays guitar as well as any session musician and his songs are clever, beautiful and brilliant. He'll say he's not a songwriter, he's never played or sung for ANYONE ... but he's MawMaw has heard him, playing his own songs down the creek. That's how she knew. But also he's her only surviving relative.

Scene opening 
- Scene 1: Alex steps off the bus into Nashville heat with the duffel and the Martin’s case, checks the time for the law firm, and heads toward the day that will tell him who his grandmother was. Keep it human. Let the city introduce itself without a speech.

## 23. Scenario: The Stadium Soundcheck - Ghost in the Machine (Age 19)

**Scene opens:** It's May 17th, 2024, 3:47 PM. Rupp Arena, Lexington. Alex is 19, working as a roadie for Thunder Road Productions. They're setting up for Zach Bryan's sold-out show tonight - 23,000 tickets. Alex was hired last minute when their regular guy broke his hand. His job: guitar tech for the opening act. But the opener's flight got cancelled. The venue is empty except for crew.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The perfect storm brewing:**
- Soundcheck in 45 minutes, no opening act
- Zach Bryan's tour manager: "Find me someone local or we're fucked"
- Alex's supervisor doesn't know he plays
- His grandmother's guitar is in Dolly (always is)
- The house sound engineer is testing the system

**What Alex doesn't know:**
- The sound engineer hit record on the board (always does for soundchecks)
- Zach Bryan is actually in his tour bus, listening through the venue feed
- Three music bloggers snuck in early, hiding in the upper deck
- His supervisor's niece is TikTok famous, just started livestreaming "sneaking into Rupp"
- The opener's cancellation was deliberate - contract dispute

**The crew dynamics:**
- Thunder Road guys protective of Alex (he's "the kid")
- Tour crew dismissive of local hires
- Lighting director: "That pretty boy? He probably plays, they all do here"
- Alex has been perfect all day - too polite, too helpful, unsettling the tour crew
- Monitor engineer notices Alex humming harmonies to the test tracks

**Hidden opportunity:**
- The stage is set for 23,000 but empty
- Full professional sound system worth $2M
- If he plays, it gets recorded in studio quality
- Zach's guitarist quit last week (band doesn't know yet)
- The venue's acoustics are legendary

**Scene opens:** Alex is coiling cables stage right when the tour manager storms onto the stage. "Where's my fucking opener?" The house lights are on full - the arena is cavernous, empty seats stretching into darkness. The sound engineer jokes into the mic: "Hell, let the pretty roadie play. Bet he knows three chords." Nervous laughter from the crew. Alex's supervisor: "Wilson, you know anyone local who can play? We need 30 minutes of music in four hours." The main PA system hums - 100,000 watts of potential. Through the loading dock, fifty feet away, Alex can see Dolly. His grandmother's guitar case visible through the windshield. The tour manager: "I'll pay $500 cash to anyone who can fill 30 minutes. Hell, $1000 if they don't suck." The monitor engineer looks directly at Alex: "Kid was humming 'Something in the Orange' in perfect harmony. Just saying." Everyone turns to stare. [What does Alex do?]

## 24. Scenario: The Flood Rescue - Songs Above Water (Age 18)

**Setup:** It's April 23rd, 2023, 11:30 PM. Pikeville is drowning. The levee failed an hour ago. Water's rising fast - already six feet on Main Street. Alex is 18, was working late at Henderson's Auto when the sirens started. Now he's in his aluminum johnboat with a flashlight, looking for survivors. The current's turned downtown into a death trap.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: [___________]

**The immediate crisis:**
- 17 people confirmed trapped in buildings
- Cell towers down, no 911
- Rescue boats overwhelmed
- Water rising 8 inches per hour
- Current too strong for swimming

**Who Alex has already saved:**
- Mrs. Chen from the flower shop (in boat now, hypothermic)
- Tommy Harlan's kids (dropped at high school shelter)
- Three dogs (tied to boat, swimming alongside)

**Who's still trapped:**
- Murphy's Bar: Eddie and 6 customers on the roof
- Elementary school: Night janitor and her granddaughter in attic
- Nursing home: Generator failed, 12 residents on second floor
- Amy Stevens: Snapchatting from her apartment, battery at 3%
- The church: Pastor James and three homeless men in the bell tower

**What Alex has in the boat:**
- His guitar (grabbed instinctively, in trash bag)
- Boat horn (broken)
- One flashlight (batteries dying)
- 30 feet of rope
- Half tank of gas

**The impossible choice approaching:**
- Current's pulling toward the nursing home
- Can hear singing from the elementary school (trying to keep the child calm)
- Murphy's roof is starting to buckle
- Amy just posted "goodbye" on Instagram
- Can't reach everyone before some buildings collapse

**Hidden dynamics:**
- Alex's father is passed out drunk in his trailer - doesn't know about flood
- National Guard unit 45 minutes out but lost
- News helicopter overhead, livestreaming
- The singing from the school is getting weaker
- The dogs know something - keep trying to swim toward the church

**Scene opens:** The johnboat scrapes against a submerged stop sign. Mrs. Chen is shaking violently, needs medical attention soon. Through the rain, Alex can see flashlights from three different buildings. Murphy's voice carries across the water: "WILSON! WE'RE SLIPPING!" From the elementary school, a child's scream. The church bell starts ringing - SOS pattern. Amy's apartment building groans, lists five degrees. The current's making the choice - pushing hard toward the nursing home where twelve voices are singing "Amazing Grace," badly, desperately. His flashlight catches something floating: a Martin guitar case from the music store, worth thousands. Then another scream from the school. Mrs. Chen grabs his arm: "Save the child. Let me steer. I'll get the others." She can barely sit up. [What does Alex do?]

- Last flight that could get him home in time leaves in 45 minutes
- ATM ate his card yesterday
- Can't wire money - no valid ID
- U.S. Embassy closed until Monday

**The desperate options:**
- German tourist offered $600 for the guitar
- Cartel-connected bar owner offered $1000 for one "favor"
- Carmen offered her mother's jewelry to pawn
- Could try to sneak through customs (security is drunk)
- American spring breakers have cash but want "entertainment"

- Warrant out for questioning (not arrest yet)
- His father's lawyer calling: "He needs to tell you something about your mother"
- Carmen's actually in love with him, planning to propose tonight
- The German tourist is a talent scout for Universal Music

- His expired passport triggers a homeland security flag
- Carmen's pregnant, hasn't told him
- The spring breakers have been recording all his beach performances

**Scene opens:** Fluorescent lights buzz in the customs line. 27 people ahead of him. 43 minutes to boarding. The German tourist holds the guitar, inspecting the neck: "Is good, ja? $600 cash, now." Carmen grips his arm: "Don't go back. Your father never loved you. Stay. We can make this work." His phone buzzes - Pikeville Hospital, he lets it go to voicemail. The customs agent is arguing with a Canadian about fees. Security guard definitely drunk, swaying. The cartel bar owner appears from nowhere: "Wilson. One hour of work. $1000. You'll make your flight." The spring breakers are getting louder: "That's him! The guy from the beach! Yo, Nobody!" They're filming. The German writes something on a business card. Carmen's crying. 25 people in line now. His phone buzzes again. [What does Alex do?]

- She's been making eyes at Alex all night
- Her guitar is a 1952 Martin worth $50K (stolen? inherited?)
- She knows who Alex is: "You're the one who plays in the mine"
- She wants to run away: "Take me with you when you leave this place"

**The pressure building:**
- Pastor Roy calling people to testify
- His father volunteering Alex: "My boy's got something to say"

- State police outside: Roy's wanted in West Virginia
- Local news filming: "Faith in Coal Country" segment
- Sarah's guitar case has $12,000 cash hidden in it
- Amy's recording everything on her phone

**The snake situation:**

- Three of the four are defanged (but which three?)
- Roy always makes the "youngest sinner" prove their faith
- Alex's father already volunteered him
- Sarah whispers: "The copper-colored one still has fangs"

**What happens if Alex refuses:**
- Father's rage returns (six days sober is nothing)
- Congregation sees him as faithless
- Loses only chance at Sarah's help escaping
- Pastor Roy focuses on Amy instead

**Scene opens:** The tent reeks of sweat, sawdust, and White Shoulders perfume. Pastor Roy's voice booms: "WHO WILL TESTIFY TO GOD'S GLORY?" Alex's father stands, hand on Alex's shoulder, grip tightening. "My boy Alexander has something to share about forgiveness." 250 faces turn. Sarah mouths "I'm sorry" from the stage. The snakes coil in their boxes, one rattling. Amy's phone flash is on. Pastor Roy smiles: "Come on up, son. Bring your pain to Jesus." His father pushes. The crowd parts. The copper-colored snake raises its head. Sarah holds up her guitar: "Maybe he could sing his testimony?" The crowd murmurs approval. A state trooper peers through the tent flap. [What does Alex do?]

**Setup:** It's September 15th, 2029, 11:47 PM. RCA Studio B, Nashville. Alex is 24, finally in a real studio. Producer Rick Rubin's giving him one night - a favor to someone who won't say who.

- The one about Nashville that burns bridges
- The one about God that questions everything
- The one about Pikeville that would destroy him there
- The one about the mine collapse that would make him famous
- The one about his grandmother that reveals everything

**Scene opens:** Studio B's live room glows warm under vintage lights. The Neve console hums. Rubin's in his beard and sunglasses at 11:47 PM: "We roll at midnight. Pick your first song now." The session players are tuning, chatting, not paying attention yet. Alex's grandfather's guitar (how did it get here?) leans against a stand. Sophie adjusts a mic: "I was there. Murphy's. 2025. You changed my life." The mystery observer shifts in the control room. A text from unknown number: "Your mother's name was really Sarah. Thought you should know before you sing." Rubin: "Eight minutes. What are we playing?" The bass player recognizes something: "Holy shit, you're Rosie Walker's grandson." Everyone stops. Looks. Waits. [What song does Alex choose first? What does he do?]

**Setup:** It's July 19th, 2020, 1:30 PM. Pike County Courthouse. Alex just turned 15 a week ago (July 12). He's been subpoenaed to testify at his father's trial for assault with a deadly weapon against Tom Morrison at Murphy's Bar. Alex is the only witness who was sober.

- David snapped: "Don't say her name"
- Tom pushed: "She was packing when she went into labor. Getting away from you"
- "She had the tickets to California. Her family was waiting"
- The beating lasted 47 seconds
- Alex counted

**The pressure:**
- If Alex tells the truth, his father gets 20 years
- If he lies, he's perjuring himself
- The whole town's watching
- Amy's in the gallery
- His grandmother's in the hospital, watching on her phone

**The CPS investigation (about to explode):**
- Sarah Martinez, CPS worker, has been digging
- Found Abigail's maiden name: Boone

**The security footage Eddie destroyed:**
- Would have shown Tom had no weapon
- Would have shown David struck first
- Would have shown Alex trying to pull his father off
- Would have shown Alex cradling Tom after
- Eddie destroyed it to protect Alex from having to testify

**What Tom was really trying to say:**
- He'd been helping Abigail escape
- Had her important documents hidden
- Birth certificate, photos, letters from California
- Hidden in Murphy's basement safe
- Was going to give them to Alex when he turned 18

**Scene opens:** The courthouse steps are limestone, worn smooth by a century of footsteps. Alex stands at the bottom, looking up. Through the doors, he can hear the bailiff: "Calling Alexander Wilson to the stand." His father's lawyer intercepts him: "Remember, son, you were in the bathroom. You didn't see nothing." The prosecutor appears: "Alex, I know this is hard. Just tell the truth." Amy pushes through the crowd: "Alex, whatever happens, I'm here." His phone buzzes - grandmother Rose from the hospital: "Tell the truth, baby. I'll protect you." CPS worker Sarah Martinez rushes up, out of breath: "Alex, wait! Don't go in yet. There's something... your mother's family... they're alive. They're coming." A black SUV convoy turns onto Main Street. His father's eyes find him through the courtroom door gap. The bailiff calls again: "Alexander Wilson to the stand." [What does Alex do?]

## 29. Scenario: The Inheritance Gambit (Revised) - Ghost in the Machine (Age 20)

**Setup:** It's September 8th, 2025, three weeks after Alex's grandmother Rose died (August 15th). Alex is 20, living in Nashville at "The Henley House" - a converted Victorian where six songwriters split rent. He's been there four months, working construction days and writing at night.

- Cannot reveal the inheritance exists until complete

**If he fails:**
- Everything goes to the Country Music Hall of Fame

- Leaves when they have house performances
- That guitar case he won't let anyone touch
- Sometimes hums melodies that sound familiar but wrong

**The timeline pressure:**
- Day 1: September 8th (today)
- Deadline: December 8th
- Must average 3-4 performances per week
- Writers' nights everywhere are booked weeks out
- Open mics are brutal and competitive
- The house does monthly showcases (but that's only 3)

**Hidden complications:**
- Jake's dad owns a publishing company, always snooping
- Sarah's been recording everyone through the walls
- Marcus recognized something in Alex's humming - a K.C. Rivers melody
- The lawyer has been checking up, asking neighbors about performances
- Tommy found a notebook page that fell from Alex's bag - lyrics that sound expensive

**The immediate problem:**
- Tonight's the Bluebird Cafe open mic lottery
- 40 people enter, 10 get to play
- Alex is standing outside at 5:47 PM
- Sign-up starts at 6:00 PM
- His housemates are all going to watch Maya (she got a slot last week)
- If he enters and gets picked, he has to explain to them

**Scene opens:** The Bluebird Cafe's line stretches around the corner. September heat makes everyone miserable. Alex clutches his grandmother's guitar - the Martin she never let him play, now his. Maya appears: "Alex! What are you doing here?" Behind her, the other housemates approach. Sarah's eyes narrow: "Is that a different guitar case?" The door opens. The woman with the clipboard starts down the line: "Open mic lottery! Name and number!" Marcus stares at the case: "That's vintage. That's... expensive." Tommy jokes: "Finally gonna play for us?" Jake pulls out his phone: "This I gotta record." The clipboard woman reaches them: "You playing or watching?" Everyone turns to Alex. Three months. Thirty performances. $2.3 million. Five hits that changed country music. A grandmother who was a ghost in the machine. "Well?" the woman asks. "The list fills up fast." [What does Alex do?]
