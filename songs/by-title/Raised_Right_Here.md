## Lyrics

(Intro – Bright banjo riff and acoustic strum, fiddle swells in the background. Tempo establishes at 112 BPM)

[Verse 1]
First steps on a porch where the screen door swayed,
Learned to say “yes, ma’am” before I could tie my lace.
Miss Ethel’s biscuits and Tommy’s old guitar,
Sunday school lessons and grease under the nails from cars.
Every holler hand had a piece of my back,
From patchin’ up my jeans to teachin’ me how to track.
I was one of their own, even when blood ran thin,
A town’s worth of love where my roots dig in.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every mile I’ve gone, every song I’ve played,
Carries the voices that shaped my name.

[Chorus]
I was raised right here, by the whole damn town,
From the preacher’s kind word to the foreman’s frown.
They taught me to work, taught me to pray,
Taught me to stand tall when the wind won’t stay.
Yeah, it takes a village, and I’m living proof,
Every brick in my backbone’s tied to their truth.
I was raised right here, and I’ll raise my glass,
To the folks who built a boy that’ll never turn his back.

(Instrumental fill – fiddle and pedal steel trading licks. Banjo maintains rhythm. Drums build slightly in intensity)

[Verse 2]
Got my first scar in Mr. Jones’ hayloft,
First job was sweepin’ that old feed shop.
Loretta patched my jacket when the winter bit hard,
And the sheriff turned a blind eye when we tore up the yard.
Learned more ‘bout life in the heat of a barn,
Than I ever did from any schoolhouse charm.
They didn’t just teach, they showed me the way,
To take care of your own and mean what you say.

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I sing my songs in some far-off place,
I’m carryin’ every handshake, every face.

[Chorus]
I was raised right here, by the whole damn town,
From the preacher’s kind word to the foreman’s frown.
They taught me to work, taught me to pray,
Taught me to stand tall when the wind won’t stay.
Yeah, it takes a village, and I’m living proof,
Every brick in my backbone’s tied to their truth.
I was raised right here, and I’ll raise my glass,
To the folks who built a boy that’ll never turn his back.

[Bridge]
So if you’re wonderin’ where I get my fight,
Why I speak my mind, why I sleep at night,
It’s ‘cause a hundred hearts kept my light aglow,
In a place where everybody knows…
That blood is thicker, that truth runs deep,
And the promise of home is a promise to keep.

[Final Chorus – Bigger, gang vocals on “raised right here”] (Chorus swells in dynamics and energy)
I was raised right here, by the whole damn town,
From the preacher’s kind word to the foreman’s frown.
They taught me to work, taught me to pray,
Taught me to stand tall when the wind won’t stay.
Yeah, it takes a village, and I’m living proof,
Every brick in my backbone’s tied to their truth.
I was raised right here, and I’ll raise my glass,
To the folks who built a boy that’ll never turn his back.

(Outro – banjo riff reprises, fiddle slides into a sustained note as the drums cut out on the last beat. Pedal steel echoes the fiddle melody subtly)

## Performance Notes

Key of G Major. Tempo is a steady 112 BPM. The song opens with a bright, energetic banjo riff over acoustic guitar strumming, setting an optimistic tone. Fiddle fills and swells in the background, adding warmth and texture. Pay attention to dynamics; build intensity gradually towards the chorus and especially the final chorus, where gang vocals are introduced for a powerful, communal feel. The fiddle and pedal steel solos should be fluid and expressive, showcasing virtuosity without overshadowing the song's emotional core. The bass line should be driving and supportive, locking in with the drums to create a solid groove. During live performances, encourage audience participation in the gang vocals on the final chorus for a truly memorable moment. The outro should be clean and concise, leaving the listener with a feeling of warmth and nostalgia. Consider adding a subtle delay effect to the pedal steel during the outro to create a spacious, echoing effect.
