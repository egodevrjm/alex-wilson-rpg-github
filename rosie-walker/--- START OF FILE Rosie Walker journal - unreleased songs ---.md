**October 19, 1971** 3 A.M. This whole town smells like stale perfume and broken promises tonight. Or maybe that’s just the smell of George’s bourbon on the pillow next to me. He’s gone, of course. He sings like an angel who’s been kicked out of heaven one too many times, and he leaves a room the same way. A beautiful, sorrowful storm that’s just passing through. We didn’t talk much. We just… recognized each other. Two ghosts haunting the same machine. The letter from RCA is on the nightstand. My lawyer sent it over yesterday. Ten years. My contract is officially fulfilled. A full decade of my life, signed away on page four of a document I was too young and too hungry to read properly. They handed me $30,000 a year and I thought I was the richest girl in Pikeville. A fortune. Now I know what it really was: the price of a soul, bought on the cheap. My voice has made them millions. My heartbreaks have paid for their houses in Belle Meade. And now they want to do it all over again. This time it’s different. They’re not dealing with a seventeen-year-old runaway anymore. They’re talking about a “king’s ransom.” Creative control. My name above the title on the album cover. A new Cadillac. They’re finally offering me the world, right at the moment I’m starting to think it’s the last thing on earth I want. They think the fight has been about money and respect. And maybe it was, for a while. But it’s not anymore. Last night, before George showed up, I was sitting here with this guitar—the sunburst he gave me years ago, the one that feels more like a part of my body than my own hands do—and I wasn’t trying to write a hit. I was trying to remember a song my grandma used to hum while she was snapping beans on the porch. I couldn’t find it. I could write a hundred songs about cheating and drinking, but I’ve forgotten the ones about the rain. Nashville has traded my memories for royalties. Now the cage door is open. My ten years are up. And everyone in this town, from Chet Atkins down to the shoeshine boy on Broadway, thinks my only question is “How much?” They think I’m sitting here, planning a negotiation. They don’t know I’m sitting here trying to remember the way home. They want to crown Rosie Walker, but all I want is to go find Rose Marie Hatfield and ask her if she’s okay. I’m not sure she is. I’m not sure she’s even been in this town at all.  
  
  
  
  
  
**October 23, 1971** *The morning after the Opry gig. I'm sick of the glitter. Sick of the lie.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The Fortunate Sons Description: A minor‑key, slow‑burn country lament (4/4, ~76 BPM) led by finger‑picked acoustic guitar and a low, pulsing floor tom. Mournful fiddle answers the vocal; a restrained electric guitar uses tremolo swells instead of flashy runs. Subtle organ pad fills the corners; brushed snare blooms into a half‑time lift in the last chorus. Natural tape warmth; arrangement stays intimate to let the lyric carry the protest.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “Billy Ray Caulfield. That’s the name that started this song. He was two years behind me in school, quarterbacked the Pikeville Panthers, and had a smile that could charm a snake out of its skin. He didn’t want to go. Nobody did. But his daddy was a miner and his granddaddy was a miner, and boys like Billy Ray don’t get deferments. They get dog tags. I was at the Opry, all decked out in Nudie’s rhinestones, singing about some made-up heartbreak, when I heard he’d been killed outside of Da Nang. I went back to the hotel, took off the glitter, and this song bled out of me. This town wants me to sing about cheatin’ hearts. But there’s a bigger, colder kind of cheating going on, and it’s breaking the only hearts that ever mattered to me.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: The Fortunate Sons)  
  
Verse 1 The letter came smudged with the postman’s hands, “Greetings,” like a thunder roll across our land. My cousin drew a number; the banker’s boy drew none— Daddy says a pen can weigh more than a gun. There’s a flag in every window on Music Row tonight, But they don’t send their own when they’re singin’ about the fight. Chorus I won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum, Or sweeten up a war with a radio hum. I’ll pray for the mothers and the folded‑up ones— But I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons. Verse 2 They said, “Girl, keep quiet, let the brass bands play, There’s a check to be cashed if you smile our way.” But the boys from the ridge got mud on their names, While town‑house sons hold spotless hands. If truth is bad for business, then business best be done— I’ll sing for the scared and the bleeding in the sun. Chorus I won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum, Or sweeten up a war with a radio hum. I’ll pray for the mothers and the folded‑up ones— But I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons. Bridge Spin that dial and cut my lines, Turn me down between the signs— A whisper through the static still outruns your funds; Truth don’t need permission and it don’t need drums. Final Chorus I won’t raise my voice for a rich man’s drum, Write lilies on a telegram for someone else’s son. I’ll sing for the dog‑tag ghosts and the ones that run— But I ain’t singin’ hosannas for the fortunate sons.  
  
  
  
  
  
**November 17, 1971** *The suit still smells like expensive cologne and fear. They think they can buy silence and compliance with a new contract and a car. I think this might be the most fun I’ve had all year.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. Atkins Can Kiss My Ass Description: Rowdy honky‑tonk shuffle (~152 BPM) with twangy electric riffs, clanking bar‑room piano, and tic‑tac bass locking to a train‑beat snare. Fiddle saws playful answers in the turnarounds; a slap‑back on the vocal adds bite. The band drops to just kick, bass, and acoustic under the bridge before a floor‑stomping final chorus.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “Had the big meeting with Mr. Guitar himself today. He sat behind that giant desk, didn’t look up for a full minute. Then he takes off his glasses and says, ‘Rosie, the numbers on the last record were… gentle. We need you to be more… palatable.’ He slid a stack of songs across the desk. Terrible, syrupy things about daisies and holding hands. He said I needed to stop wearing the black jeans, cut the ‘sullen’ act, and be the nice girl he knows I can be. I just looked at him. At his perfect suit and his perfect hair. And I thought about every compromise, every time I bit my tongue, every time I smiled when I wanted to scream. I stood up, pushed his awful songs back into his lap, and said, ‘Chet, you can take your palatability and shove it.’ I didn't write this song. I just reported the facts."  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: Atkins Can Kiss My Ass)  
  
Verse 1 He said, “Darlin’, hush that gravel, we’ll drown it in strings, Powder up your cheekbones, we’ll sell pretty things.” I said, “Honey, keep your violins outta my song— If you wanted lace curtains, you hired me wrong.” Chorus Atkins can kiss my ass— I ain’t your porcelain pass. Turn the steel up hot, let the kick drum crash; If the truth sounds rough, then buy more glass. Write it on a bar‑nap—frame it in brass: Atkins can kiss my ass. Verse 2 “Smile more for the cameras, be the girl they adore.” I smiled when I meant it, and I walked off the floor. Keep your hair dye, diet, and the sequined leash— My boots ring truer than your velvet speech. Chorus Atkins can kiss my ass… (repeat as above) Bridge You can stack a hundred fiddles, hire a choir of ten, But a lie still cracks like a cheap champagne. I’ll sing it how I live it—smoky, loud, and fast; Put that in your ledger and kiss my ass. Final Chorus/Tag Atkins can kiss my ass— Print it big, sweetheart, and bill me last.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**December 3, 1971** *The phone rang ten times this morning. It was George twice, the lawyer once, and RCA seven times. They want to know my intentions. My intention is to write the truth and leave the polite heartbreak songs to the others. I’m tired of romanticizing his sorrow just because it sells records.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. Whiskey’s Just a Chorus (New Song) Description: A slow, brutally honest country-blues in 4/4 at 60 BPM. Sparse instrumentation: George’s sunburst acoustic, a sad, slow, walking upright bass, and Rosie’s bitter vocal. No pedal steel, no strings—just the raw sound of two instruments and a voice. It’s a song about rejecting the beautiful lie of the tragic drunk man.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: "I am the one who is supposed to be the outlaw, the mess. But he's the one who writes the script for his own tragedy every night. He sings about the whiskey being the devil, but he drinks it like a muse. They call him a genius, a beautiful broken man. I call him a selfish baby who found a way to make his vice into an art form. My albums are full of songs about how his sorrow is beautiful. It’s not. It’s boring and it’s loud, and it's the only story he knows how to tell. I will not be the sad, silent woman watching him be great anymore. The tragedy is that it’s all a performance."  
  
(Song: Whiskey’s Just a Chorus)  
  
(Verse 1) You pour another glass and the sad strings start to play You're drowning every promise in the sorrow of the day They call it the demon, but it makes you look like a saint The genius with a problem that the good Lord's just acquainted You sing about the heartbreak like you only just found out But you're the one who wrote the ending when you picked the bottle out.  
  
(Chorus) Whiskey’s just a chorus when you’re standin’ on the stage It’s the beautiful confession that gets printed on the page You don't want a savior, you don't want a single cure You just want the audience to know you're honest and you’re pure Well, I've had every verse of that tired, cheating song And I'm leaving for the place where the truth can't be bought for long.  
  
(Verse 2) I’m tired of the drama and the curtains and the cues The velvet-lined destruction that you dress up in your blues I’m tired of the applause for every time you fall apart Like being the disaster is your only kind of art You’re the King of broken chords and the master of the tear And I'm the one who stands here holding all the secrets of the fear.  
  
(Chorus) Whiskey’s just a chorus... (repeat as above)  
  
(Outro) I won't be your co-star anymore... I won't be your excuse. (Acoustic guitar and bass fade slowly, leaving a single, quiet strum.)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**April 1, 1972 (Not an April Fool, unfortunately)** *The town is starting to feel small. Every face I see is a lie or a transaction. I saw the ugly machine today, and I saw the pretty faces that oil its gears.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. Nashville Babylon Description: A slow, menacing, country-noir ballad at 65 BPM. The song slinks in on an upright bassline that walks through the verses like a private eye in a smoky bar. A tremolo-soaked electric guitar answers Rosie’s vocal lines with mournful, weeping phrases. The drums are barely there—just a whispered hi-hat and a ghostly cross-stick on the snare. Rosie’s vocal is a conspiratorial, bitter whisper, recorded dry and close to the mic, making every cynical observation feel like a shared, dangerous secret.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “It’s all fake. The whole damn town. I saw one of my heroes, a man who sings gospel on Sundays, passed out drunk with a girl half his age in his Lincoln Continental. I saw a ‘happily married’ duet act throwing glasses at each other backstage before they went out and sang about forever. They sell ‘three chords and the truth,’ but the truth is the one thing you can’t have. It’s a city built on beautiful lies. They’ll take your pain, shine it up, put it on a record, and leave you with the bill for the rhinestones. I used to think this was Jerusalem. Turns out it’s Babylon. And the writing is on the wall.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: Nashville Babylon)  
  
(Intro - Upright bassline walks alone for two bars, then joined by a single, tremolo-heavy guitar chord)  
  
(Verse 1) The Saint of the Opry, with his Bible and his tie Keeps a bottle of pills in his boot heel on the sly He sings about redemption with a tear in his eye Then meets a different angel when the sun has left the sky And the Queen of the Airwaves, with a voice of pure spun gold Sings of forever love, but her own is bought and sold.  
  
(Chorus) Welcome to Nashville Babylon, where the saints are made of rust Where they'll build you up with promises and bury you in dust They'll take your soul for a souvenir, your pain for a number one And smile right in your face until the dirty deed is done.  
  
(Verse 2) The biggest man at the label, he's a deacon at his church Left a girl from Chattanooga cryin' in the lurch She was singin' for a contract, he was lookin' for a thrill Another ghost with a guitar stranded at the foot of Music Hill Now she's waitressing on Broadway, humming what might have been And he's at a fancy dinner, committing another sin.  
  
(Chorus) Welcome to Nashville Babylon... (repeat as above)  
  
(Bridge - Electric guitar plays a lonely, bluesy melody over the bassline)  
  
(Verse 3) They call me the wild one, the sinner, and the shame 'Cause I won't play their dirty little star-making game But I've seen the righteous crumble, I've seen the faithful fall And the biggest joke in this whole town is I'm the worst of them all I'd rather be a sinner who is honest in her rage Than a smiling hypocrite locked up in their golden cage.  
  
(Outro) Yeah, welcome to Babylon… Don't let the rhinestones fool you... On your way down. (Bass and guitar fade, leaving only the sound of a fading guitar tremolo)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**April 15, 1972** *The car is a bribe. I'm starting to see every beautiful thing they give me as a tool to keep the cage door shut.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The Prettiest Cage Description: A mid-tempo country-rock anthem of defiance at 120 BPM. This track has a stronger pulse than her earlier work, with a powerful, steady drum beat and a driving bassline that feels like a heart gathering courage. Twangy Telecaster guitars trade licks with a Hammond B3 organ, giving it a sound that bridges classic country with a tougher, blues-rock edge. Rosie's vocal is the centerpiece—not bitter, but soaring and determined. It's the sound of a decision being made in real-time.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “They gave me a brand new Cadillac last week. Pearl white. A ‘bonus’ for the last album going gold. I drove it out to Percy Priest Lake, parked, and just stared at the water. I thought about the first guitar I ever had, a beat-up Sears Silvertone my uncle gave me. I thought about how a new set of strings felt like the greatest luxury in the world. Now I have a car I’m scared to scratch and a closet full of rhinestone jackets I don’t even like. They give you just enough pretty things to make you forget you’re trapped. They praise your fire, then hand you a golden fire extinguisher. This isn't a life. It's a residency. A beautiful, comfortable, soul-crushing residency in the prettiest cage they could build. The bonus isn't the car. It's the realization that I can just leave the keys in it and walk away.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: The Prettiest Cage)  
  
(Intro - A driving drum beat and a confident, twangy guitar riff in G)  
  
(Verse 1) They built this cage for me with bars of solid gold Gave me a velvet swing and a story to be told Dressed me up in diamonds, put a guitar in my hand Said, "Sing for us, little bird, you're the finest in the land." They painted a horizon on the wall behind my perch So I could sing of freedom without leaving their damn church.  
  
(Verse 2) They told me what to sing and they told me what to wear "Don't get too political, don't show you even care. Just smile for the cameras, girl, and hide your tangled wires, And we'll feed you fame and fortune to fuel your pretty fires." They loved the songs of heartbreak, they loved the songs of pain As long as I remembered to never name the names.  
  
(Chorus) But the door was never locked, I just never thought to try Was so mesmerized by glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly This ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take This bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake 'Cause a cage is still a cage, no matter what it's made of.  
  
(Bridge) They love a broken woman, they can sell her tragedy But a woman who knows her own mind is their worst catastrophe They can keep the golden bars and the high-society rage 'Cause a free bird in the mountains beats a queen in the prettiest cage. Yeah, a free bird in the mountains is turnin' her own page.  
  
(Guitar and Hammond Organ Solo - energetic and liberating)  
  
(Final Chorus) Oh, the door was never locked, I just never dared to try Was so mesmerized by glitter, I forgot I knew how to fly This ain't a palace, it's a prison, and I've had all I can take This bird is done with singin' for the zookeeper's sake! Yeah, this bird is breaking out of the prettiest cage.  
  
(Outro - Band holds a final chord, which fades out leaving just the sound of a single guitar note ringing with feedback)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**June 2, 1972** *Peggy. I don't know what to write here. The betrayal feels colder than any industry backstab. The kind of person who can smile over a lie that intimate isn't a friend, she's an assassin. And she got paid for the job. It’s a sad, sad town when your best friend is just waiting to sell your secrets for a better spot on the marquee.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. Rhinestone Judas Description: A classic, slow-burning country heartbreak waltz in 3/4 time at 68 BPM. The track is drenched in sorrow, led by a weeping pedal steel guitar and a sparse, mournful piano that plays teardrop-like notes. A brushed snare and a quiet upright bass keep the waltz time. Rosie's vocal is weary and wounded, recorded with a touch of natural echo as if sung in a vast, empty hall. It cracks with raw emotion on the high notes, a masterful performance of betrayal.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “Her name was Peggy. She came to town the same time I did, with a guitar case just as battered and eyes just as wide. We were roommates, sisters-in-arms. I got signed first, and I pulled her up with me. Got her a job singing backup, lent her money, gave her my songs when she was short on material. I told her everything. Told her about George, about the baby, about how I felt like I was suffocating. Last week, an executive at the label ‘suggested’ I take some time off for my ‘health.’ He knew things, intimate things, that only one person could have told him. Then I hear Peggy’s been given a solo spot on the big New Year’s Eve show. My spot. It wasn’t a knife in the back. It was a sequined glove, patting my shoulder as it pushed me off the ledge.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: Rhinestone Judas)  
  
(Intro - A single, sorrowful pedal steel note slides down, followed by a sparse piano melody in D)  
  
(Verse 1) You borrowed my lipstick, you borrowed my car You were right there beside me at every cheap bar We were soldiers of fortune in this neon-lit war Swore we'd have each other's backs, and what's more, I told you my secrets, the dark and the deep The promises I couldn't possibly keep.  
  
(Verse 2) You smiled at my parties and drank all my wine Said, "Rosie, I'll have your back, sister, any old time." But when the rumors were flyin' and my name turned to mud You were the one holdin' the shovel and spillin' the blood You just nodded and listened, with a sad, tender grace While you were rehearsing to take over my place.  
  
(Chorus) Oh, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls But you were just another ambitious girl I should've seen the envy hidin' in your eyes Beneath the hollow laughter and the gossamer lies You kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me for a song My Rhinestone Judas, I should've known all along.  
  
(Bridge - Pedal steel solo, weeping over the slow waltz) I hope you get that record deal, I hope you get the fame I hope every time you hear my music, you burn with the shame 'Cause you can't build a mansion on a foundation of sin And the ghost of my trust is a guest you'll be lettin' in For thirty silver dollars, or a spot on the stage You helped me write the final words on this gilded cage.  
  
(Final Chorus) Yes, a friend's a rare diamond in this town of fake pearls You were just the most clever of the ambitious girls I saw the hunger lurking there behind your pretty eyes Beneath the careful sympathy and well-rehearsed goodbyes You kissed me on the cheek, then you sold me for a song My Rhinestone Judas... God forgive me, I knew it all along.  
  
(Outro - Piano plays a few final, sparse notes as the pedal steel holds a long, fading cry)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**June 5, 1972** *The industry is a mirror that only reflects the sadness it wants to sell. I’m done with being their tragic heroine. I’m a woman, not an adjective. I need to write songs that refuse to be background music to a breakdown.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The Jukebox Ain't My Confessor (New Song) Musical description: A gritty, mid-tempo bar-room banger at 130 BPM with a dominant, driving piano and aggressive electric guitar fills. The rhythm section is loud and unpolished, mimicking the sound of a live band in a smoky joint. The vocal is a sneer, a direct confrontation with the music she is tired of singing and hearing.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: "I walked into a dive last night. Saw a woman sitting alone, crying into a flat beer. What was playing? My own damn song, 'Broken Bottle Blues.' I was selling her misery back to her, and making a fortune off of it. They love a song that wallows, a song that gives you permission to be pathetic. They want me to write another one. But my pain is my own now, not a three-minute track for a nickel. I'm done being a jukebox for other people's cheap sorrows."  
  
(Song: The Jukebox Ain't My Confessor)  
  
(Verse 1) They drop a quarter in the slot and the needle finds the groove They want a little wallow, a soundtrack for a move To a phone booth or a highway, a whiskey and a plea To hear a voice of sorrow that sounds exactly like me They want the tear-stained melody, the sad, poetic lie That says it's beautiful to break down and cry.  
  
(Chorus) The jukebox ain't my confessor, the barstool ain't my pew I'm done with selling sad songs for a crowd that just wants two More verses of the tragedy, the hook that keeps them numb This three-chord therapy for hire is finally overcome I'm taking back the copyright to every single pain I'm done with being a jukebox in this Nashville pouring rain.  
  
(Verse 2) The radio's full of women with a quiver in their throat Singing 'bout a dress they bought, a letter that he wrote All of them are angels who were only slightly soiled Their sadness neatly packaged, perfectly unspoiled But my kind of heartbreak is a hole and not a crack And I'm not putting that darkness on another vinyl track.  
  
(Chorus) The jukebox ain't my confessor... (repeat as above)  
  
(Bridge) You want a tear? I'll give you a scream. You want a story? I'll give you the dream Of a woman who walked out with the silence for her guide And left the whole sad industry nowhere to hide.  
  
(Outro) No more lullabies... no more blues... The jukebox is empty. (Piano and guitar clash on a final, dissonant chord, then stop abruptly.)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**July 14, 1972** *A boundary is a beautiful thing. It’s a song with two letters. I keep forgetting I don’t have to answer the phone or take the meeting. I’m free. I just have to remember how to say it.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The Girl Named No Musical description: Up‑tempo shuffle (~124 BPM) with jangly acoustic strums, walking bass, and train‑beat snare. Fiddle and electric guitar trade call‑and‑response fills; a gang‑vocal “NO!” punctuates the chorus. Short solo break leads into a breakdown bridge with just claps, bass, and voice. Theme/Overview: A boundary‑setting anthem—catcalls, gatekeepers, and grabby hands meet a two‑letter gospel. File beside tough‑minded, witty barnburners that turn a catchphrase into a chorus you can stomp to. Lyrics: Verse 1 Don’t call me “baby” when you want my time, Don’t touch my waist when I’m holdin’ my line. Ask for a smile? I’ll give you a show— A little two‑letter word you’re fixin’ to know. Chorus I’m the girl named No, write it big on the bill, Sounds like thunder rollin’ down a Tennessee hill. Try your luck, cowboy, but here’s how it goes— If respect ain’t first, then the answer is No. Verse 2 Suits in the office say “sweeten that hook,” I slid their script back: “Take a second look.” If I gotta be smaller for your money to show, You can keep your wallet; I’ll keep my No. Bridge (breakdown) No to the pinch, no to the grin, No to the dress that I’m “meant” to be in. Yes to my voice, yes to my road— If you can’t hear that, then hear my No. Final Chorus/Tag I’m the girl named No… now you know.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**September 12, 1972** *Felt him kick for the first time today. Not a flutter, but a real, solid kick, right under my ribs as I was trying to write some throwaway line about a truck stop. It knocked the breath right out of me. I dropped the pen and just laid my hand on my stomach. In this whole loud, lying town, this is the only thing that’s real. This is my sparrow. George will only ever see him as a beautiful piece of evidence, a proof of his own wildness. I can’t let him be born here. I won’t let them turn his life into a tragedy they can sell on an album.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. A Song for a Sparrow Description: An incredibly intimate and tender lullaby at 60 BPM. This is the rawest recording in the collection, featuring just Rosie and her acoustic guitar, recorded so closely you can hear the soft whisper of her fingers on the frets and the quiet intake of her breath. Her vocal is not a performance; it's a soft, loving murmur, full of the hope and fierce protectiveness of a mother-to-be. It’s a secret shared between two heartbeats.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “His father is a legend, but he’s also a storm. A beautiful, brilliant storm that I can’t live in anymore, and I won’t raise a child in its path. This song isn’t for RCA. It’s not for the Opry. It’s just for him. So someday he’ll know this was never about running away from him. It was about running toward him.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: A Song for a Sparrow)  
  
(Intro - A few simple, gently finger-picked chords on an acoustic guitar, played softly in G)  
  
(Verse 1) Hello in there, my sparrow, can you hear this old guitar? It's the only thing your mama's got that's followed her this far You're a secret that I'm keepin', a whisper in my soul A tiny spark of future that will finally make me whole And you're rolling like the thunder that your father always brings But I'm gonna teach you quiet, and the peace of silent things.  
  
(Verse 2) Your father's got a voice of angels, and a heart that's wild and loud He can make the heavens listen from the front row of a crowd But that world of smoke and stages ain't no place to learn to fly So we're headed for the mountains, little sparrow, you and I He gives away his pieces 'til there's nothing left to own And I won't let you be one more thing he has to leave alone.  
  
(Chorus) And I will sing you songs of creeks and sleepy, sunlit dawns Not of barrooms, broken bottles, and the lovers who are gone You'll know the sound of whippoorwills before the Opry train And you'll grow up wild and sturdy, clean and honest as the rain This world can't have you, little one, this world is not our friend This is a mother's promise on which you can depend.  
  
(Bridge) I don't have much to give you, just a trailer and a name A solemn vow to shield you from the burnin' of the fame And this beat-up old guitar for when you learn to find your own A better life is waitin' than the one I've ever known A quiet life, a steady life, a life that's truly real.  
  
(Outro) Sleep now, little sparrow... let the mountains be your shield. Mama's taking you home. (Guitar resolves on a soft G chord and fades)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**October 1, 1972** *He came by last night. Drunk, of course. Said he’d leave her, that he’d be the man I deserved. He sang me a new song he’d written, and for three minutes, he was the brilliant, beautiful man I fell in love with. Then he passed out on my couch. I put a blanket over him and sat there all night, just watching him. I am giving him a great, dramatic song for his final curtain. I owe him that much. The amputation is complete.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The King of Broken Things Description: A grand, dramatic torch song at a funereal 55 BPM. This is Rosie's final goodbye to the Nashville sound and the man who embodied it for her. The track opens with a lonely piano, soon joined by swelling orchestral strings and a heart-wrenching pedal steel. Rosie's voice is at its most powerful and polished, a knowing nod to the Nashville production she is rejecting. It’s a performance filled with love, profound pity, and the cold, hard pain of a necessary amputation.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “He’s a king. The king of heartbreak, the king of a sad country song. But his kingdom is made of glass, and he’s always the one holding the hammer. I love him. God help me, I will always love him. But you can’t save a man from his own throne. I wrote this while he slept. It's the last song I'll ever write about him. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to a clean goodbye.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: The King of Broken Things)  
  
(Intro - A spare, melancholy piano melody in C minor, joined by the sorrowful cry of a pedal steel)  
  
(Verse 1) You wear a crown of neon, you hold a scepter of regret You're the undisputed sovereign of the ones we can't forget Your kingdom is a barstool, your castle's built on shame And every heart you conquer only learns to curse your name You rule a million jukeboxes, a million lonely nights Beneath the pale and buzzing glow of the cheap motel room lights.  
  
(Verse 2) You sang a song for me once, with a voice so pure and true For a moment, I saw the angel that was buried deep inside of you You built a world in three short minutes, a world I'd die to own Then you smashed it into pieces and left me there alone That's your most tragic talent, the one that sets you high apart You know just how to build a world before you break a heart.  
  
(Chorus) So hail to the king of broken things, the lord of the last call The poet of the pieces after the great fall I loved you more than reason, but less than my own life And I can't be another jewel in the crown of your lonely strife Your throne is built on sorrow, your anthem is the blues And being just your empress is a role I must refuse.  
  
(Bridge - Strings swell dramatically, carrying the melody as the pedal steel weeps) They'll say I was the wild one who couldn't be controlled But the truth is, I was sober enough to see a story getting old You can't build a home inside a hurricane's eye And this was my one moment to say a real goodbye Before your beautiful destruction became my own.  
  
(Final Chorus) So long live the king of broken things, in his castle made of pain The poet of the whiskey tears and the lonely, midnight rain I loved you more than my own soul, but less than the one I saved And I can't be another headstone on the path your sorrow paved. Long live the king... The lonely, lonely king of broken things.  
  
(Piano and pedal steel play a final, fading outro)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**November 25, 1972** *I’m not Rosie Walker anymore. I’m Rose Marie Hatfield. My mama’s mama’s blood. It's the strongest part. It knows the way home. I won't let them erase the part of me that knows how to survive.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. River of Ghosts Description: A haunting, atmospheric folk song with a non-traditional structure, set to a hypnotic 75 BPM. The track is built on the foundation of an open-tuned acoustic guitar, creating a droning, almost mystical rhythm. A low, mournful cello provides the bass notes, moving slowly beneath the guitar. There are no drums. Rosie’s vocal is chant-like and powerful, less a melody and more an incantation. It connects her personal story of escape to a much older, deeper story of survival and identity rooted in her Cherokee heritage.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “Chet once told me to ‘smile more’ because my cheekbones were a ‘great asset.’ Said my grandmother must have been a real beauty. He had no idea. My grandma was a Hatfield, but her mama was Cherokee. She taught me things the Bible never did. About listening to the land. About how some rivers hold the memories of everyone who ever drank from them. Nashville tried to make me into a simple, digestible product. A ‘Country Rose.’ They celebrated the part of me that was white and pretty, and they told me to hide the rest. But the rest is the strongest part. It’s the part that knows how to survive. This isn’t just me leaving Nashville. It’s the river of my ancestors finally washing me clean and carrying me home.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: River of Ghosts)  
  
(Intro - Acoustic guitar in an open C tuning plays a repeating, droning, rhythmic pattern. A low cello note enters beneath it.)  
  
(Verse 1) The man from the label, he looked at my face Said, "The cheekbones are great, but we gotta erase Any hint of the wildwood, the dark river's shore, We're selling a country rose, nothing less, nothing more." He gave me new boots and a name that felt wrong And told me to hide my grandmother's tongue in my songs.  
  
(Verse 2) But he don't know my grandma, with her hair long and black Who walked a trail of sorrow and never looked back She taught me that silence can be a warrior's shield And a woman's true strength is the truth she won't yield She said, "This world will try to name you, to claim you as its own, But you listen for the water, and you'll never be alone."  
  
(Chorus) There's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins It sings of survival through droughts and through rains It's older than Nashville, it's stronger than fame And it's whisperin' to me, "Go remember your name." It's callin' me homeward, away from this place With the mud of the mountain still fresh on its face.  
  
(Bridge - Cello plays a mournful, melodic solo line over the droning guitar) They took our land, they took our tongue, they tried to take our soul But you can't kill a spirit that you cannot control And every time I sing a song of leavin' and of loss I'm singin' for the ancestors who paid the bitter cost This ain't no song of heartbreak, it's the paying of a debt To the women who kept walking, so I would not forget.  
  
(Final Chorus) There's a river of ghosts runnin' deep in my veins... (repeat as above)  
  
(Outro - The droning guitar and cello continue, slowly fading out like a river flowing into the distance)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**December 10, 1972** *Was looking at a copy of Music City News today. Saw my own face staring back at me under the headline ‘Rosie Walker: Queen of Country Soul.’ But that’s not my name. Rosie Walker is a costume. She’s a character I play for RCA Victor. My real name is Rose Marie Hatfield. It’s the name my mama whispered to me. It’s carved into the bark of a big beech tree by a creek in Pike County. That tree knows me better than anyone in this town. Rosie Walker belongs to Nashville. She can have it. Rose Marie Hatfield belongs to the mountains. And I’m finally ready to take her home.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. This Holler Holds My Name Description: A gentle, deeply nostalgic folk tune at 90 BPM. The song slinks in on an upright bassline that walks through the verses like a private eye in a smoky bar. A tremolo-soaked electric guitar answers Rosie’s vocal lines with mournful, weeping phrases. The drums are barely there—just a whispered hi-hat and a ghostly cross-stick on the snare. Rosie’s vocal is a conspiratorial, bitter whisper, recorded dry and close to the mic, making every cynical observation feel like a shared, dangerous secret.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “A quiet rejection of everything Nashville stood for.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: This Holler Holds My Name)  
  
(Intro - Simple, clean finger-picking on an acoustic guitar in C)  
  
(Verse 1) They gave me a new name, they gave me a new town Put my face on a record that spun 'round and 'round Called me the "Bad Girl," the "Wild Child," the "Queen" But that ain't the woman I was ever meant to have been She's a stranger in a mirror, she's a well-rehearsed part With a rhinestone-covered surface where she used to have a heart.  
  
(Verse 2) 'Cause my soul ain't made of neon, my heart don't beat in time With the rhythm of the deal-makers on the Music Row line My blood runs thick with coal dust, my spirit with the pine And the face in all the magazines was never truly mine It was just a photograph of someone I agreed to be for pay.  
  
(Chorus) But this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree The one my mama gave me, the one that sets me free The Cumberland River knows it, the mountain mist and rain I'm goin' back to the only truth that washes off the pain Rosie Walker's famous, but Rose Marie is home.  
  
(Bridge) Let 'em wonder what happened to the girl with the green eyes Let 'em write their cautionary tales filled with rumors and with lies I'll be on a front porch swing, where the evening crickets drone Learning how to be myself again, and finally not alone With the ghosts of generations who knew this ground I'm on.  
  
(Final Chorus) Yeah, this holler holds my real name, carved into a beechwood tree The one my daddy gave me, the one that sets me free The Cumberland River knows it, the mountains know it, too I'm goin' back to the only love I ever really knew Rosie Walker's fading, but Rose Marie is home.  
  
(Outro - Acoustic guitar finger-picking slows and resolves on a final, peaceful C chord that rings out)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**December 31, 1972** *Packed tonight. One suitcase. Filled it with my daddy’s flannel shirts, two pairs of jeans, a book of poems, and the notebook. The rest of it… the Nudie suits, the rhinestone dresses, the fan mail… I piled it all in the middle of the floor of this apartment that RCA pays for. It looked like a shrine to a dead woman. I found the publicity photos for the last album. The ones where they put me in that white, frilly paper-looking dress and told me to look ‘vulnerable.’ I was playing a part, wearing a costume made of paper. It was never real. I took a match and lit the corner of one of the photos. Then I tossed it on the pile. There’s no going back when the bridges are ash. This whole chapter is done. I wrote the one final song they'll never hear, the one that sums up the whole decision.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. Burn the Paper Dress Description: A sparse and percussive acoustic track at 110 BPM. The driving rhythm comes from Rosie's own hand hitting the body of her Martin guitar, creating a raw, determined heartbeat. Her acoustic guitar plays a simple, repeating riff in a minor key. There are no other instruments except for her voice, which is layered in a simple, self-made harmony on the chorus. It’s not a song of anger, but of ritual and cleansing.

(Song: Burn the Paper Dress)  
  
(Intro - A single, repeating acoustic guitar riff in A-minor, with a percussive slap on the guitar body on the 2 and 4 beats)  
  
(Verse 1) The woman in the magazines, she's got my eyes, my mouth She's smiling for the camera as she's headin' ever south They put her in a paper dress, a crown of paper lies And told her she was queen of all the things that she despised She sold her pain for pennies, she sold her ghost for gold And did every single thing the men in power told.  
  
(Verse 2) Tonight I read her letters, the ones from girls back home Who said her voice had saved them from feelin' all alone And for a single second, a sadness cut me through For killing off the only saint they ever thought they knew But that saint was just a story, a well-constructed myth And I can't live inside a cage of someone else's wish.  
  
(Chorus) So I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame Every single article that ever wrote my name I'm pilin' up the evidence of a life that wasn't mine And offerin' the whole damn thing up to the turpentine Let the fire take the fake girl, let the smoke forget the rest Tonight I burn the paper doll, tonight I burn the dress.  
  
(Bridge) They'll say I lost my mind, or I ran off with a man They'll never understand it was the only sane plan You can't just walk away from a ghost that wears your face You have to perform an exorcism to leave the haunted place.  
  
(Final Chorus) So I'm takin' all the pictures, the records and the fame... (repeat as above)  
  
(Outro - The percussive slapping and the guitar riff continue for a few bars then stop abruptly)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**January 1, 1973** *It’s 2 AM at the Greyhound station. The bus to Kentucky leaves in ten minutes. My song came on the little transistor radio the ticket-taker has on his counter. ‘Baptized in Bourbon.’ It sounds like it was sung by a different person. A loud, brave, broken girl I used to know. It’s a strange thought, that for the rest of my life, that girl will still be out there. She’ll be singing in bars I’m not in, coming out of radios in cars I’ll never see. I’m leaving, but she has to stay. I’m setting her free to be a ghost, a story. From tomorrow on, she’s not my problem. She’s just a voice in the air.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The Ghost in the Radio Description: A haunting, ethereal ballad at a slow 70 BPM. The sound is drenched in the echo and reverb of a classic 1960s recording, but the instrumentation is minimal: a lonely, tremolo-heavy electric guitar plays a simple arpeggio, while a brushed snare and a stand-up bass keep a quiet, swaying rhythm. Rosie’s vocal is distant and soft, as if she’s already broadcasting from somewhere far away. It is her final reflection on the persona she is about to abandon.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “I’m leaving, but she has to stay. I’m setting her free to be a ghost, a story. From tomorrow on, she’s not my problem. She’s just a voice in the air.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: The Ghost in the Radio)  
  
(Intro - A slow, tremolo-soaked electric guitar arpeggio in E-minor)  
  
(Verse 1) The neon sign is humming a sad and lonely tune Reflected in a puddle beneath a cloudy moon The man behind the counter is listenin' to my song About a girl who got it right by gettin' everything wrong He's tappin' out the rhythm, he doesn't look at me He doesn't see the person that I no longer want to be.  
  
(Verse 2) That girl, she's full of whiskey, she's full of cheap regret She's a three-minute distraction from a life you ain't lived yet She'll sing you through the night shift, she'll get you through the drive She'll make you feel for just a spell, a little more alive She's everything they made her, she's brave and she's a mess And I'm the only one who knows it's all a wilderness.  
  
(Chorus) And soon that's all I'll be, a memory in a wire A disembodied voice that's for public rent and hire Singin' 'bout a heartbreak from a million miles away From the woman I'll be living as, starting from today Let her sing forever, let her tear her heart in two The ghost in the radio has nothing more to do with you.  
  
(Bridge) She'll always be nineteen, with a fire in her eyes She'll never have to compromise, she'll never have to lie She's frozen in the amber of a three-chord tragedy And the greatest gift I give her is to finally set her free.  
  
(Outro) Yeah, the bus is pulling out now, leaving her behind A story on the airwaves, a comfort for the kind Who need to hear a sad song... from the ghost in the radio. (The tremolo guitar holds a final, shimmering chord that slowly fades to silence)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**January 2, 1973** *The sun is coming up over the Cumberland Gap. The bus crossed the state line into Kentucky about ten minutes ago. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a prettier sunrise. All pink and orange over the mountains that raised me. I’m not Rosie Walker anymore. I’m not even Rose Marie Hatfield yet. I’m just a woman on a bus, with a baby in her belly and a guitar in her lap. I don’t know what happens next. For the first time, I have no contract, no tour dates, no expectations. There’s no map. It’s terrifying. And it’s the most wonderful feeling in the world. This is it. Page one. I think this last song is the only one that matters.*  
  
  
  
  
  
1. First Day of My Life Description: A simple, unadorned folk hymn. The only sound is Rosie’s voice and her acoustic guitar, playing a straightforward chord progression reminiscent of a Carter Family song. Her vocal is quiet, clear, and utterly devoid of Nashville artifice. It’s not sad, it’s not angry; it’s calm and full of a quiet, dawning hope. This is the last song in the notebook, the sound of a woman taking her first breath of free air.  
  
Rosie's Rough Notes/Story: “I’m on a bus, with a baby in her belly and a guitar in her lap. I don’t know what happens next. It’s terrifying. And it’s the most wonderful feeling in the world.”  
  
  
  
  
  
(Song: First Day of My Life)  
  
(Intro - A simple, steady acoustic guitar strumming a C-G-F-C progression)  
  
(Verse 1) The glass is cold against my head, the engine makes a groan The diesel fumes are smellin' like the seeds of goin' home The sun is just a rumor on the black and hazy line Of the mountains of Kentucky that have always been all mine. The driver doesn't know me, and I don't know his name Just two more weary travelers in a long and tired game.  
  
(Verse 2) My hands ain't full of diamonds, my boots ain't made of hide There's nothin' in my suitcase that I have any need to hide Got a notebook full of goodbyes, and a heart that's full of prayer And a ticket in my pocket that could take me anywhere But it's only taking me to where I should have been right from the start.  
  
(Chorus) And the sun comes up like absolution, orange, pink, and bright And I feel a generation's worth of darkness turn to light I take a breath and watch the frost melt off the window pane And I hear the quiet whisper of the gently fallin' rain The past is just a story someone else will have to write 'Cause this is the first morning of the first day of my life.  
  
(Bridge) No more songs of leavin', no more songs of bein' wronged No more songs of tryin' to find the place where I belong I'm already there.  
  
(Final Chorus) And the sun comes up like absolution, orange, pink, and bright... (repeat as above)  
  
(Outro - The simple C-G-F-C progression repeats twice and ends on a clean, final C chord)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Note with no details** *This is the final word on the whole affair. A summation. The note I should have left on the nightstand.*  
  
Smart Girls Go Home A slow, aching country ballad in 3/4 at 72 BPM unfolds with finger-picked acoustic guitar, upright bass, and brushed snare, Pedal steel sighs gently; mournful fiddle shadows vocals from verse two, Sparse piano colors key lines, while light harmonies lift choruses, Intimate, woody, natural sound  
  
Verse 1 New Year’s Eve, rhinestones, Opry lights, Camera like a moon on a midnight tide. She changed one line, bowed to no one’s throne, Whispered to the mic, “Bad girls leave town—smart girls go home.” A bus coughed smoke like a sinner’s prayer, Ticket in her boot, red dust in her hair. A suitcase, a notebook, a round-shouldered guitar’s tone, And a tiny hidden echo—smart girls go home.  
  
Verse 2 He was a barroom hymn with a neon crown, Voice could hush a fight in any jukebox town. Hands that shook like leaves when the bottle got loud, But a gentle kind of thunder when the stage met the crowd. He pressed that sunburst soundboard into her palms, Said, “Play it mean, play it honest, and play past the applause.” She kissed his knuckles, left the roses by the phone, Left the ringin’ of his sorrow—smart girls go home.  
  
Chorus Run, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you, Two heartbeats in the dark, one you’re tryin’ to find, too. There’s a future in the holler where the coal trains moan, Where a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone. Let the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone— You’re runnin’ for a better life… smart girls go home.  
  
Verse 3 December snow on the Cumberland pines, She counted mile markers like rosary lines. The city kept calling with a preacher’s tone, “Come back, be forgiven,” but the price was her soul. So she held her stomach like a secret flame, Promised the life inside a different name. In a window’s ghost she saw a mother she’d never known— And in the glass, a singer, finally not alone.  
  
Chorus Run, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you, Two heartbeats in the dark, one you’re tryin’ to find, too. There’s a future in the holler where the coal trains moan, Where a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone. Let the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone— You’re runnin’ for a better life… smart girls go home.  
  
Bridge Someday a boy will wonder why his voice feels like a storm, Why a sad song fits his chest the way a jacket keeps you warm. He’ll hold that sunburst, chipped and worn, and not quite know from whom— Only feel the way a lonesome note can open up a room. And she’ll be on a porch swing where the mountain shadows roam, Smilin’ at the secret that carried them both home.  
  
Final Chorus Run, Rosie, run, let the past turn into smoke, Let the gossip drown in whiskey, let the promises stay broke. There’s a cradle in the cabin and a name you’ll call your own, There’s a heartbeat like a sparrow sayin’, “Mama, take me home.” Leave the neon to the night and the crown to some other throne— You saved a life by leavin’... smart girls go home.
