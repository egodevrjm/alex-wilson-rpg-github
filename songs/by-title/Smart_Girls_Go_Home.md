## Description
A deeply personal and emotionally resonant country ballad in 3/4 at 72 BPM. "Smart Girls Go Home" is a poignant narrative about resilience, motherhood, and finding solace in one's roots. The song unfolds with a finger-picked acoustic guitar melody and subtle brushed snare drumming, creating an intimate and heartfelt atmosphere. Upright bass provides a solid foundation, while pedal steel guitar weeps and sighs in the background. A mournful fiddle enters on the second verse, shadowing Rosie Walker's lead vocal, which is both vulnerable and strong. Sparse piano chords emphasize key lyrical phrases, and layered harmonies lift each chorus. The production emphasizes natural acoustics, capturing the warmth and raw emotion of the performance. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a woman's journey from the glittering lights of Nashville to the quiet strength of her Appalachian home, grappling with choices, societal pressures, and the unwavering pull of family. A true country heartbreaker, sung by a true country voice.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
New Year’s Eve, rhinestones, Opry lights,
Camera like a moon on a midnight tide.
She changed one line, bowed to no one’s throne,
Whispered to the mic, “Bad girls leave town—smart girls go home.”
A bus coughed smoke like a sinner’s prayer,
Ticket in her boot, red dust in her hair.
A suitcase, a notebook, a round-shouldered guitar’s tone,
And a tiny hidden echo—smart girls go home.

Verse 2
He was a barroom hymn with a neon crown,
Voice could hush a fight in any jukebox town.
Hands that shook like leaves when the bottle got loud,
But a gentle kind of thunder when the stage met the crowd.
He pressed that sunburst soundboard into her palms,
Said, “Play it mean, play it honest, and play past the applause.”
She kissed his knuckles, left the roses by the phone,
Left the ringin’ of his sorrow—smart girls go home.

Chorus
Run, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you,
Two heartbeats in the dark, one you’re tryin’ to find, too.
There’s a future in the holler where the coal trains moan,
Where a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone.
Let the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone—
You’re runnin’ for a better life… smart girls go home.

Verse 3
December snow on the Cumberland pines,
She counted mile markers like rosary lines.
The city kept calling with a preacher’s tone,
“Come back, be forgiven,” but the price was her soul.
So she held her stomach like a secret flame,
Promised the life inside a different name.
In a window’s ghost she saw a mother she’d never known—
And in the glass, a singer, finally not alone.

Chorus
Run, Rosie, run, with the mountain wind behind you,
Two heartbeats in the dark, one you’re tryin’ to find, too.
There’s a future in the holler where the coal trains moan,
Where a wild girl can be brave enough to lay a cornerstone.
Let the headlines keep their hunger, let the gossip chew the bone—
You’re runnin’ for a better life… smart girls go home.

Bridge
Someday a boy will wonder why his voice feels like a storm,
Why a sad song fits his chest the way a jacket keeps you warm.
He’ll hold that sunburst, chipped and worn, and not quite know from whom—
Only feel the way a lonesome note can open up a room.
And she’ll be on a porch swing where the mountain shadows roam,
Smilin’ at the secret that carried them both home.

Final Chorus
Run, Rosie, run, let the past turn into smoke,
Let the gossip drown in whiskey, let the promises stay broke.
There’s a cradle in the cabin and a name you’ll call your own,
There’s a heartbeat like a sparrow sayin’, “Mama, take me home.”
Leave the neon to the night and the crown to some other throne—
You saved a life by leavin’… smart girls go home.

Tag
Bad girls go to Nashville…
But the bravest girls go home.
