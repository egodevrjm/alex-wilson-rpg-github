## Description
A rowdy, heartwarming barroom two-step celebrating life's milestones and everyday joys. Alex Wilson's Kentucky baritone voice shines over a brisk shuffle tempo (~128 BPM) driven by twangy Telecaster riffs, barrelhouse piano, and a walking upright bass. The chorus explodes with fiddle counter-melodies over steel guitar pads and gang vocals chanting the title hook, creating a singalong atmosphere. The verses maintain a lean, rootsy feel with rimclicks and acoustic strumming, while the bridge offers a poignant reflection on cherished memories and hopeful futures. The production aims for a live-in-the-room feel, capturing the warm, slightly overdriven lead vocal amidst the wood, glass, and buzzing neon of a honky-tonk.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Screen door slaps on a neon night,
jukebox coughing up a nickel tune.
Paper crown from the lost-and-found,
leaning sideways like a harvest moon.
Bartender grins, says, “Name your wish,”
writes it crooked on a chalkboard sign.
Friends roll in like a summer storm,
and every laugh says, “Boy, it’s time.”

Pre-Chorus
Phone’s lit up, boots line up,
somebody hollers, “Make it clink!”
If you love me, don’t you tell me—
show me with another drink.

Chorus
Birthday drinks—line ’em up on the bar like candlelight,
let the good times run and the bad times take the night.
Raise that glass to the ones we lost and the ones we ain’t met yet,
to the wrong turns, right songs, no-regret sunsets.
If the world keeps spinning, we’ll keep singing till the neon blinks—
tonight I’m counting blessings, not years—just birthday drinks.

Verse 2
Old man Earl’s in his Sunday hat,
two-steppin’ like he’s twenty-two.
New girl laughs at the way I dance,
says, “Son, I hope your wish comes true.”
Someone’s mama brought a peach pie ’round,
some kid’s carving dates in the window seat.
Whole town turns to a chorus line
when the shuffle finds a steady beat.

Pre-Chorus
Phone’s lit up, boots line up,
somebody hollers, “Make it clink!”
If you love me, don’t you tell me—
show me with another drink.

Chorus
Birthday drinks—line ’em up on the bar like candlelight,
let the good times run and the bad times take the night.
Raise that glass to the ones we lost and the ones we ain’t met yet,
to the wrong turns, right songs, no-regret sunsets.
If the world keeps spinning, we’ll keep singing till the neon blinks—
tonight I’m counting blessings, not years—just birthday drinks.

Bridge
Here’s to first loves, broke-down trucks,
payday Fridays, second chances, stubborn luck.
Here’s to porch swings, county lines,
cheap guitars that saved our lives.
Blow that wish across my lips,
let the sparks fall where they may—
if joy’s a tab we never close,
put it on me anyway.

Instrumental Break (8 bars): Telecaster solo with Fiddle backing

Chorus
Birthday drinks—line ’em up on the bar like candlelight,
let the good times run and the bad times take the night.
Raise that glass to the ones we lost and the ones we ain’t met yet,
to the wrong turns, right songs, no-regret sunsets.
If the world keeps spinning, we’ll keep singing till the neon blinks—
tonight I’m counting blessings, not years—just birthday drinks.

Tag
So light me up another wish and let the glasses clink—
I’m only getting older in the best way: birthday drinks.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Telecaster (twangy lead, some chicken pickin'), Acoustic Guitar (rhythm), Piano (barrelhouse style, comping and fills), Upright Bass (walking bassline), Drums (snare on 2 & 4, rimclicks in verses), Fiddle (counter-melodies, solos), Steel Guitar (pads in chorus), Tambourine, Handclaps.
Tempo: Brisk shuffle at ~128 BPM.
Key: G Major (works well with the described instrumentation and baritone vocals).
Production Notes: Emphasize a live-in-the-room sound. Use minimal reverb on the drums to keep them punchy. The lead vocal should be slightly overdriven for a warm, intimate feel. The gang vocals in the chorus should be layered and feel natural, not overly processed. Consider adding a subtle delay to the Telecaster solo to enhance its twang. The instrumental break after the bridge offers a chance for the Telecaster and Fiddle to trade licks. Add a slight build in intensity leading into the final chorus with heavier handclaps and tambourine. The Steel guitar should be mixed low in the verses and pre-chorus but brought forward in the chorus to provide a lush harmonic bed.
