## **Good Morning America | 7:00 AM ET**

**ROBIN ROBERTS:** Good morning, America\! And what a morning it is\! We're interrupting your July 4th celebrations with breaking news from the music world that has everyone talking.

**GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:** That's right, Robin. Overnight, Netflix released a documentary that solved one of music's greatest mysteries. Country legend Rosie Walker, who vanished in 1973, spent the last 50 years living quietly in Kentucky.

**ROBIN:** But George, that's not even the biggest surprise. Her grandson, 22-year-old Alex Wilson, has been working in a coal mine with no idea about his grandmother's identity. Our Gio Benitez is LIVE in Pikeville, Kentucky. Gio, what's the scene there?

**GIO BENITEZ:** Robin, George, I'm standing outside what can only be described as absolute chaos. Behind me is the modest trailer where Alex Wilson lives, and there are literally hundreds of people here, news vans from every major outlet, and yes \-- those are helicopters overhead. The remarkable thing? Sources tell us Alex is still asleep inside, unaware that his life has completely changed.

**GEORGE:** Gio, have you been able to speak with anyone who knows him?

**GIO:** George, the locals are being very protective. The owner of Murphy's Bar, where Alex performs, has refused all interviews. His best friend Tommy Crawford has been tweeting increasingly frantic updates. The last one simply said, quote, "fuck all of you."

**ROBIN:** \[laughing\] Well\! Happy Fourth of July, America\!

**STEVE INSKEEP:** This July 4th morning, we're examining a uniquely American story of fame, disappearance, and rediscovery. Last night, Netflix released "Finding Rosie," a documentary that revealed the fate of country music legend Rosie Walker.

**RACHEL MARTIN:** Steve, for context, Rosie Walker was arguably one of the biggest stars of the early 1970s before she vanished without a trace. Her music has remained culturally significant \-- streamed hundreds of millions of times, covered by everyone from Johnny Cash to Florence and the Machine.

**INSKEEP:** The documentary reveals she'd been living as Judith Wilson in Pikeville, Kentucky, where she raised her grandson, Alex. Here & Now's Robin Young spoke with music historian Robert Christgau about the significance of this discovery.

**ROBERT CHRISTGAU \[tape\]:** What's remarkable isn't just that we've solved this mystery, but what it reveals about the music industry of that era. Rosie Walker was on what we call a 360 deal before that term existed \-- the label owned everything. She walked away from fame but also from any financial benefit of her life's work. Her grandson, who's been working in a coal mine, is about to experience a complete reversal of fortune.

**MARTIN:** And Steve, there's already discussion about the legal implications. Who owns the rights to any unreleased material? Does Alex Wilson have any claim to his grandmother's catalog?

**INSKEEP:** Questions that will likely play out over the coming months. This is NPR News.

**After 50 Years, the Riddle of Rosie Walker Is Solved**

*By Jon Pareles*

The mystery that has haunted Nashville for half a century was resolved in the early hours of July 4, when a Netflix documentary revealed that the vanished country music star Rosie Walker had been living in Pikeville, Ky., under the name Judith Wilson until her death in 2022\.

The revelation, delivered 71 minutes into "Finding Rosie," includes another twist: Ms. Walker's grandson, Alex Wilson, 22, who works in a coal mine, was unaware of his grandmother's identity. The documentary's cameras captured him performing at a local establishment with what experts have confirmed is Ms. Walker's 1959 Martin D-28 guitar, known to fans as "Betty."

The implications for the music industry are significant. Ms. Walker's catalog, owned entirely by Sony Music Entertainment under a predatory contract signed in 1963, generates millions in streaming revenue annually. Mr. Wilson's potential claims to his grandmother's unreleased material could set up a legal battle with profound implications for artist rights.

According to sources familiar with the matter, multiple record labels have already dispatched representatives to Pikeville, a town of 8,000 in Eastern Kentucky. The scene there was described as "chaotic" by local law enforcement.

**Rosie Walker: American Country Legend's 50-Year Disappearance Solved**

The film reveals that Walker, who sold millions of records globally and influenced artists from Dolly Parton to British acts like Florence and the Machine, lived under the assumed name Judith Wilson in rural Kentucky until her death in 2022\.

Her grandson, Alex Wilson, a 22-year-old coal miner, was unaware of his grandmother's identity. The documentary has sparked extraordinary scenes in the small town of Pikeville, Kentucky, with hundreds of people and international media descending on what local police describe as an "overwhelmed community."
