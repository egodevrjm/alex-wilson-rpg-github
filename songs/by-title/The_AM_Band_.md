## Description
A heartfelt country ballad exploring the solace and spiritual connection found in country music broadcast on the AM radio waves. "The AM Band" reflects on the power of music to provide comfort and community, particularly for those who feel disconnected from traditional religious institutions. The song blends gospel undertones with classic country themes of heartache, redemption, and the search for meaning.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
No steeple bell to call my name, no polished wooden pew
Just a crackle from the dashboard, lettin' Sunday morning through
WPKE on the dial, a little faded, soft and low
Pays the gospel hour for the faithful, and for the souls who can't go.

(Chorus)
And this is my Church of Country, broadcast on the AM band
Where the sermon's from a steel guitar, held in a sinner's hand
The DJ is the preacher, and the songs are the prayers I know
Salvation in a three-chord truth, on the only road I go.

(Verse 2)
The choir fades out softly with "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" 
Then the DJ cues up Hank Williams, and a different prayer is spoken
One song's about a mansion, the other a honky-tonk floor
But it's all the same salvation knockin' at my truck door.

(Chorus)
'Cause this is my Church of Country, broadcast on the AM band
Where the sermon's from a steel guitar, held in a sinner's hand
The DJ is the preacher, and the songs are the prayers I know
Salvation in a three-chord truth, on the only road I go.

(Bridge)
Some folks find their comfort when they're kneeling on the floor
I found mine in Johnny Cash when daddy slammed the door.
He sang about the sinner, not the righteous or the proud
And for a boy who couldn't speak, Waylon's voice got awful loud.

(Verse 3)
Static clingin' to the antenna, hummin' along to every word
More honest than the Sunday sermon, the kind I never heard.
My daddy's whiskey, mama's worry, whispered on the air
The truth ain't always pretty, but it's a burden I can bear.

(Chorus)
'Cause this is my Church of Country, broadcast on the AM band
Where the sermon's from a steel guitar, held in a sinner's hand
The DJ is the preacher, and the songs are the prayers I know
Salvation in a three-chord truth, on the only road I go.

(Outro)
Yeah, the DJ signs hisself off... says "'til next week's show..."
And the steel guitar just fades out... steady, soft, and slow.
Amen.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked), pedal steel guitar (prominent, with subtle bends and volume swells), upright bass, minimal percussion (brushes on snare, occasional kick drum), Hammond organ (soft chords), harmonica (mournful solo in the bridge), electric guitar (plaintive lines in the chorus), backing vocals (close harmonies, gospel-tinged).
Tempo: Slow to mid-tempo, around 70 BPM.
Key: G Major
Structure: Verse 1 - Chorus - Verse 2 - Chorus - Bridge - Verse 3 - Chorus - Outro
Mood: Reflective, tender, nostalgic, hopeful. The song should evoke a sense of quiet reverence and the warmth of a Sunday morning.
Performance Notes: Vocals should be delivered with sincerity and vulnerability. The pedal steel guitar is crucial for creating the atmosphere and should be played with feeling and restraint. The harmonica solo in the bridge should be mournful and expressive. Backing vocals should be layered and blend seamlessly with the lead vocal.
