## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Got my tackle box and my old blue jeans
Picked you up in my Chevrolet
Down to the water where the cypress leans
Just like every Friday in May
Your hand in mine on the bench seat
Radio playing our favorite song
First love feels like summer heat
Praying this feeling won't be gone

[Chorus]
Summer on the river, you and me
Stars dancing on the water so free
Tailgate down, your head on my chest
Summer on the river, loving you the best
Summer on the river, summer on the river

[Verse 2]
Casting lines but we're catching dreams
Your laugh echoes off the hills
Everything's better than it seems
When you're here giving me chills
Polaroid pictures in your phone
Promise me you won't forget
How we carved our names in stone
Down where the sun and water met

[Chorus]
Summer on the river, you and me
Stars dancing on the water so free
Tailgate down, your head on my chest
Summer on the river, loving you the best
Summer on the river, summer on the river

[Bridge]
Now September's calling you away
College town, bigger dreams
But I still hear you say
You'll remember summer on the stream
Driving away in your daddy's car
With a promise you'll be back soon
But I know that things have gone too far
To be kissing under the moon

[Chorus]
Summer on the river, you and me
Stars dancing on the water so free
Tailgate down, your head on my chest
Summer on the river, loving you the best
Summer on the river, summer on the river
Summer on the river

[Outro]
Oh, summer on the river
Yeah, I remember summer on the river

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked intro and strummed rhythm), electric guitar (clean tone, adding subtle fills and a melodic solo in the bridge), bass guitar (walking bass line in verses, more driving in choruses), drums (steady, mid-tempo country groove with a slight backbeat emphasis), pedal steel guitar (adding atmospheric textures and fills), backing vocals (harmonies in the chorus and bridge).
Tempo: Medium tempo, around 100 bpm. The song should have a relaxed, nostalgic feel.
Key: G Major
Structure: The song follows a standard verse-chorus structure, with a bridge providing emotional contrast. Pay attention to dynamics - build intensity in the choruses and bring it down for the verses.
Performance: Alex should deliver the vocals with sincerity and vulnerability, conveying the emotions of young love and heartbreak. The electric guitar solo should be melodic and tasteful, fitting the overall vibe of the song. The pedal steel guitar adds a signature country sound, while the backing vocals enhance the harmonies and create a fuller soundscape. The bridge should be sung with a sense of longing and regret.
