## Description
A heartfelt country-pop anthem about chasing dreams in Nashville and finding your place amidst the overwhelming energy of the city.

## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Packed my truck with a guitar and a dream
Left Pike County for that Nashville scene
Now I'm standing on Broadway with my jaw on the ground
There's more people on this block than in my whole hometown

Chorus:
I'm lost in the city lights, don't know left from right
Where's the courthouse, where's the water tower?
Used to know every face, now I'm lost in this place
But I'm chasing that Nashville power
Lost in the city lights tonight

Verse 2:
Tried to order sweet tea, they looked at me funny
Parking costs more than I make in a week, honey
Everybody's got their face stuck to a phone
Making me miss that holler back home

Chorus:
I'm lost in the city lights, don't know left from right
Where's the courthouse, where's the water tower?
Used to know every face, now I'm lost in this place
But I'm chasing that Nashville power
Lost in the city lights tonight

Bridge:
Yeah, I stumble 'round, feelin' out of place
The honky-tonks are loud, a blur of lights and bass
But when I pick up this guitar and sing
All these strangers start to feel like kin
Maybe I ain't lost, maybe I'm just found
In a different kind of small town

Chorus (Key change):
I'm lost in the city lights, but it feels alright
Found my stage, found my tower
Learning every face in this crazy place
Chasing down that Nashville power
Lost in the city lights tonight
Lost in the city lights tonight

Outro:
City lights, city lights, shining down on me
City lights, city lights, where I'm meant to be
Lost in the city lights tonight

## Performance Notes

Tempo: Moderately paced with a slight driving feel. Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar is the foundation, supported by electric guitars (Telecaster with a bit of twang), bass guitar (walking bass line in verses), drums (subtle country rock groove), pedal steel guitar (for emotional textures in the bridge and choruses), and optional backing vocals (harmonies on choruses). Key Change: Final chorus should modulate up a half-step or whole step (e.g., from G to G#/Ab or A) to increase energy. Emphasis on the 'Nashville power' line in the chorus â€“ it's the emotional core. Vocals: A slightly vulnerable, yet optimistic tone. Build the energy throughout the song, culminating in a powerful final chorus. The pedal steel should really soar in the outro during the 'City Lights' repetitions. Consider adding a brief instrumental solo (guitar or pedal steel) after the second chorus or before the bridge. The bridge should have a slight dynamic drop before building back into the final chorus.
