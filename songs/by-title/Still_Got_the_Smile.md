## Description
A mid-tempo country-pop anthem of resilience and quiet optimism. "Still Got the Smile" blends the twang of acoustic rhythm guitar and subtle banjo with the ethereal shimmer of steel guitar swells, all grounded by a contemporary snap-pop drum loop. Alex Wilson's playful Kentucky baritone leads the way, with layered harmonies sweetening the chorus. The song exudes a warm, confident, yet softly reflective vibe, hinting at heartbreak but ultimately celebrating the enduring power of positivity.

## Lyrics

(Verse 1)
You took your records and your coffee cup
Left the porch swing still half-set up
You even grabbed that old denim coat
But forgot the note I never wrote

I watched taillights disappear in July
Thought I’d break—but I didn’t cry
Just sat in the dark, hummed that old Haggard line
And let the screen door slam one last time

(Chorus)
You left the town, you left the bed,
Took the dog and the flannel I liked best
Tore up the pictures, burned the miles—
But baby, you still got the style
And I got a heartbreak, sure for a while
But hey—I still got the smile
Yeah, you’re gone and the nights went wild
But darlin’… I still got the smile

(Verse 2)
You played your part in the goodbye scene
Left like a ghost on a movie screen
But I found light in the radio’s tune
And the way my boots still echo this room

You had your reasons, I won’t chase
We both knew love ain’t always grace
But every friend says “Man, you’re okay?”
I just laugh and say, “Most days”

(Chorus)
You left the town, you left the bed,
Took the dog and the flannel I liked best
Tore up the pictures, burned the miles—
But baby, you still got the style
And I got a heartbreak, sure for a while
But hey—I still got the smile
Yeah, you’re gone and the nights went wild
But darlin’… I still got the smile

(Bridge)
Maybe someday we’ll meet again,
At a diner or through some old friend
You’ll look at me, try to fake surprise
But I’ll just grin and you’ll recognize…

(Final Chorus – harmony stacks, rising instrumentation)
You left the town, you left the bed,
But not the jokes or that line you said
I’ve healed the hurt, walked every mile
And baby… I still got the smile
Didn’t need closure, just took a while
But darlin’… I still got the smile

(Outro – acoustic fade, spoken echo)
Still got it, yeah…
Still got the smile.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Start with a dry, intimate acoustic guitar (Martin D-28 suggested) playing a simple chord progression in the verse. Add the drum loop subtly, almost like a heartbeat. The banjo should be sparse, providing color rather than driving the rhythm (think Béla Fleck-inspired fills). The steel guitar should be used sparingly for atmospheric swells, creating a sense of longing. The bass guitar enters more prominently in the chorus, providing a solid foundation. Stack vocal harmonies in the chorus, starting with a simple two-part harmony and building to a fuller three-part arrangement in the final chorus. The outro should feature a gentle acoustic guitar fade-out, with the final line spoken with a hint of wistfulness.

Tempo: Keep the tempo relaxed and unhurried. The goal is to create a feeling of quiet reflection.

Key: The song is well-suited for a major key (G major works well) as it reinforces the positive and optimistic theme.

Performance Notes: The lead vocal should be delivered with a conversational, slightly raspy tone. Emphasize the storytelling aspect of the lyrics. The harmonies should be tight and blend well with the lead vocal. The instrumentalists should listen to each other carefully and create a cohesive soundscape. The bridge should be performed with a slight increase in intensity, building anticipation for the final chorus. The final chorus should be the most dynamic part of the song, with all instruments and vocals reaching their peak. Pay close attention to dynamics throughout the song to create a sense of ebb and flow. Consider adding a subtle delay effect to the steel guitar and lead vocal to enhance the dreamy atmosphere.
