## Lyrics

(Intro - Traditional twangy acoustic guitar riff blending with modern drum beats, building an anthemic feel-good vibe, like a resilient ride through open plains. Pedal steel enters subtly, adding a layer of warmth)

(Verse 1)
I've been thrown from the saddle, dust in my eyes,
Heart took a beatin' under stormy skies.
Lost my way in the canyons, felt the cold night wind,
But I dusted off my hat, and rode on again.
Life's a wild bronco, tryin' to throw you down,
But I hold the reins tight, stand my ground.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through the highs and the lows, the wins and the ache,
One thing I know, for goodness' sake.

(Chorus - Anthemic, feel-good lift with soaring vocals, fiddle swells, and modern rhythms. Harmonies enter on 'Cowboys don't break')
Cowboys don't break, we bend with the storm,
Rise from the fall, keep pushin' on.
In love or in life, we weather the fight,
Hearts made of steel under wide open light.
Yeah, cowboys don't break, we heal and we grow,
Chasin' that horizon, lettin' our true colors show.
No, cowboys don't break!

(Verse 2)
She walked away leavin' trails in the sand,
Thought I'd shatter like glass in my hand.
But I picked up the pieces, learned to stand tall,
Found my strength in the rise after the fall.
Now the sun's risin' higher, lightin' my path,
Love's comin' back, no lookin' at the past.

(Pre-Chorus)
Through the twists and the turns, the joy and the pain,
One truth remains, like summer rain.

(Chorus - Building energy, full band with empowering hooks. Drums become more prominent)
Cowboys don't break, we bend with the storm,
Rise from the fall, keep pushin' on.
In love or in life, we weather the fight,
Hearts made of steel under wide open light.
Yeah, cowboys don't break, we heal and we grow,
Chasin' that horizon, lettin' our true colors show.
No, cowboys don't break!

(Bridge - Music pulls back to acoustic twang, then surges modern. Vocals become more raw and emotional)
When the trail gets rough and the nights feel long,
Remember your roots, where you belong.
We're built for the battle, forged in the fire,
Risin' stronger, takin' it higher.
We carry the spirit, the soul of the West,
A legacy of courage, put to the test.

(Chorus - Massive, anthemic finale with crowd-ready chants. All instruments at full power. Ad-libs and vocal runs from Alex Wilson) 
Cowboys don't break, we bend with the storm,
Rise from the fall, keep pushin' on.
In love or in life, we weather the fight,
Hearts made of steel under wide open light.
Yeah, cowboys don't break, we heal and we grow,
Chasin' that horizon, lettin' our true colors show.
No, cowboys don't break!

(Outro - Fades with twangy guitar and rhythmic echoes. Pedal steel sustains a final chord)
Yeah, we don't break...
Cowboys don't break...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Lead vocal (male, gritty, with a drawl), acoustic guitar (twangy), electric guitar (with overdrive for solos), pedal steel guitar, fiddle, bass guitar, drums (modern kit with country accents), backing vocals (harmonies on chorus). Tempo: Mid-tempo, around 96 BPM. Mood: Uplifting, defiant, nostalgic, anthemic. The song should build in intensity from the intro to the final chorus. Pay close attention to dynamics to create a powerful emotional impact. The bridge should be a moment of vulnerability before the final surge. The outro should feel like a sunset over the plains, fading gradually. Consider adding a guitar solo after the second chorus to build energy.
