## Lyrics

(Intro - Gritty acoustic riff with banjo twang, building to a stomping drum kick, like a Kentucky bonfire rally kicking off)

[Male - Verse 1]
I’m a backroad renegade, boots caked with clay,
Breakin’ every rule that the townfolks say.
They want me in a suit, punchin’ clocks by nine,
But I’m chasin’ sunsets with a jug of shine.
No picket fence gonna lock this soul,
I’m a wild horse runnin’, takin’ my own road.

[Female - Verse 2]
I’m a rebel in denim, hair flyin’ in the breeze,
Ditchin’ their plans for these fields and trees.
They say “Settle down, girl, find a proper life,”
But I’m dancin’ barefoot, cuttin’ loose like a knife.
Ain’t no box can hold this heart of mine,
I’m a spark in the dark, let it burn, let it shine.

[Both - Pre-Chorus]
They draw their lines, but we don’t care,
We’re livin’ free, breathin’ open air.

[Both - Chorus - Anthemic, singalong hook with gang vocals and fiddle bursts]
No fence around us, we’re runnin’ wild and free,
Kickin’ up dust, where we’re meant to be.
Oh oh, break the rules, let the good times soar,
No fence around us, we’re forevermore!
From the bonfire blaze to the starlit skies,
We’re livin’ our truth, no compromise.
No fence around us, yeah, that’s our jam,
Sing it loud, y’all, we don’t give a damn!

[Male - Verse 3]
Got a cooler in the truck, and a fire in my chest,
Raisin’ hell with my crew, we don’t need no rest.
They call me trouble, say I’m bound to fall,
But I’m laughin’ loud, answerin’ my own call.
This life’s a party, and I’m settin’ the pace,
No gate’s gonna stop this Kentucky race.

[Female - Verse 4]
I’m swingin’ on the tailgate, stars my only guide,
No preacher’s sermon gonna tame my stride.
They want me proper, in a Sunday dress,
But I’m howlin’ at the moon, causin’ my own mess.
This heart’s untamed, and it’s burnin’ bright,
Lightin’ up the backroads in the dead of night.

[Both - Pre-Chorus]
They build their walls, but we tear ‘em down,
Two rebels runnin’ free through this small town.

[Both - Chorus - Bigger, stadium-ready with crowd chants]
No fence around us, we’re runnin’ wild and free,
Kickin’ up dust, where we’re meant to be.
Oh oh, break the rules, let the good times soar,
No fence around us, we’re forevermore!
From the bonfire blaze to the starlit skies,
We’re livin’ our truth, no compromise.
No fence around us, yeah, that’s our jam,
Sing it loud, y’all, we don’t give a damn!

[Both - Bridge - Pulls back to acoustic stomps, then explodes]
Let ‘em talk their talk, let ‘em judge and stare,
We’re too busy livin’, breathin’ freedom’s air.
No ropes, no chains, just our hearts in flight,
Two sparks ignitin’ the Kentucky night!

[Both - Chorus - Massive, singalong finale with whoops and hollers]
No fence around us, we’re runnin’ wild and free,
Kickin’ up dust, where we’re meant to be.
Oh oh, break the rules, let the good times soar,
No fence around us, we’re forevermore!
From the bonfire blaze to the starlit skies,
We’re livin’ our truth, no compromise.
No fence around us, yeah, that’s our jam,
Sing it loud, y’all, we don’t give a damn!

[Both - Outro - Fades with banjo riff, electric wail, and rowdy cheers]
No fence around us... yeah, wild and free!
Sing it loud, y’all... eternally!

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (rhythm and lead fills), Banjo (prominent twangy riffs and solos), Electric guitar (Southern rock-inspired licks and wails), Bass guitar (driving, melodic lines), Drums (Stomping kick and snare, driving hi-hats), Fiddle (Celtic-inspired melodies, bluegrass flourishes), Pedal Steel guitar (Swells and sustained notes for atmosphere), Male and Female lead vocals (Kentucky drawl, strong harmonies), Gang vocals (Stadium-style singalong). Tempo: The song should maintain a driving tempo throughout. The bridge allows for a brief dynamic break before exploding into the final chorus. Key elements: Call and response between male and female vocals. Focus on creating a raw, energetic sound, as if performing live at a bonfire party. Use plenty of reverb on the drums and vocals to create a stadium-like atmosphere. The banjo should be bright and prominent in the mix. Consider adding subtle backing vocals during verses to fill out the sound. During the outro, the electric guitar can perform a bluesy solo as the song fades out.
