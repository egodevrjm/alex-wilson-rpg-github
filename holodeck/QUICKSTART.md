# QUICKSTART GUIDE - ALEX WILSON HOLODECK

**Get playing in 5 minutes**

## Step 1: Start a Conversation with Claude

Open a new conversation and paste this:

```
I want to run an Alex Wilson Holodeck session.

Please load:
- holodeck/engine_prompts.md (act as World Engine)
- FINAL/ALEX WILSON — CORE BIBLE (use).md
- FINAL/Alex Wilson - The Cheat Sheet (use).md

I'm ready to direct. Awaiting my first scene setup.
```

## Step 2: Set Your First Scene

Choose a starting point:

### Option A: Classic Struggle
```
SCENE: Alex is broke, it's rent day, and he's $800 short.
He's sitting in his Nashville apartment trying to figure out options.
Age 22, solo mode.
```

### Option B: Broadway Grind
```
SCENE: Alex is playing a Friday night set at Robert's Western World.
The crowd is rowdy, and his guitar string just broke mid-song.
Age 22, with Tommy.
```

### Option C: Industry Moment
```
SCENE: Alex has a meeting with an A&R rep from a major label.
She saw him play last week and wants to talk.
Age 22, solo mode, Tommy coached him beforehand.
```

### Option D: Homecoming
```
SCENE: Alex is driving back to Pike County for the first time in months.
He needs money and took a gig there. It's complicated.
Age 22, solo mode.
```

### Option E: Surprise Me
```
SCENE: Alex is 22, in Nashville, been here 3 years.
Create an interesting starting situation.
```

## Step 3: Respond to What Happens

When Claude creates a scene, respond naturally:

```
Alex plays "Dirt Road Destiny" and watches the crowd
```

```
Alex tells her the truth about Pike County
```

```
Alex calls Tommy for help
```

## Step 4: Use Commands as Needed

### To Skip Time
```
JUMP: Three days later
```

### To Check State
```
CHECK: How much money does Alex have?
```

### To Get Full Status
```
INVENTORY
```

### To Discuss Options
```
PAUSE: What are Alex's realistic options here?
```

### To Try Different Choice
```
REWIND: Actually, Alex doesn't take the gig
```

## Step 5: Keep Playing

The World Engine will:
- Track all stats precisely
- Load relevant context automatically
- Play Alex and all NPCs
- Maintain consequences
- Generate rich, specific scenes

You:
- Direct where scenes go
- Respond to situations
- Use commands to control flow
- Collaborate with Claude on the story

## Common First-Time Questions

**Q: Do I play as Alex or direct him?**
A: You direct. Claude plays Alex. You set scenes and respond to what happens.

**Q: How much do I need to specify?**
A: Enough to set context. "Alex at a bar" is too vague. "Alex playing Tuesday night at Tootsie's, thin crowd, exhausted from day job" is perfect.

**Q: What if I don't know Nashville venues/lore?**
A: Just describe the type of scene you want. Claude will fill in specific details from the canon files.

**Q: Can I create new characters?**
A: Yes, but Claude will prioritize using canon NPCs from the repository when they fit.

**Q: What if things go off track?**
A: Use PAUSE to discuss, or REWIND to try different choices.

**Q: How long should a session be?**
A: Anywhere from 3-5 scenes (quick session) to 20+ scenes (epic session). Your call.

**Q: Can I continue where I left off?**
A: Yes. Start new session with: "Continue from last session where [describe endpoint]"

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific about context**: Time of day, Alex's state, recent events matter

2. **Let consequences play out**: Don't reset things artificially, let problems compound

3. **Use PAUSE freely**: Collaborate with Claude on direction and options

4. **Mix commands with natural language**: You don't need rigid syntax

5. **Trust the World Engine**: Let Claude surprise you with NPCs and situations

6. **Focus on interesting choices**: Look for decisions where all options have trade-offs

7. **Remember logistics**: Money, energy, hunger, time all matter

8. **Embrace complications**: Perfect solutions are boring, messy outcomes create story

## Example Opening Exchange

```
YOU:
SCENE: Alex is at a coffee shop in Nashville, working on a song.
He's got $12 in his pocket and hasn't eaten since yesterday.
A well-dressed woman keeps glancing at him.

CLAUDE:
[Creates scene with full header, describes coffee shop, the woman,
Alex's state, and what's happening. Ends with choice point.]

YOU:
Alex ignores her and focuses on the song he's writing

CLAUDE:
[Shows Alex working, but situation develops - maybe she approaches
anyway, or something else happens, or Alex's hunger becomes a problem]

YOU:
[Respond to what actually happened]
```

## Different Session Styles

### 1. Sandbox Exploration
Set a scene and follow where it naturally goes

### 2. Scenario-Based
```
I want to play the "Creator House Crucible" scenario
```

### 3. Character Study
```
FOCUS: I want to explore how Alex deals with grief
SCENE: [grief-related setup]
```

### 4. Consequences Stress Test
```
SCENE: Everything Alex has been avoiding comes due at once
```

### 5. Campaign Mode
Run connected sessions building a longer story

## If Things Feel Off

**If scenes feel too sitcom-y:**
```
TONE: More prestige realism, less comedy beats
```

**If pacing is wrong:**
```
TEMPO: Slow down, give me more details
(or)
TEMPO: Speed through this part
```

**If you're lost:**
```
PAUSE: Can you summarize current situation and my options?
```

**If something doesn't match canon:**
```
PAUSE: Would Alex actually do this? Seems off-character
```

## You're Ready

That's it. You now know enough to start.

Pick a scene, set it up, and see what happens.

The holodeck awaits.
