## Description
A deeply emotional pop country ballad about loss, remembrance, and the enduring power of family. "Cheap Seats" tells the story of a rising country star who promised his grandmother, watching from the balcony seats, that he'd never forget her support. After her sudden passing, he finds solace and strength in the memory of her love, feeling her presence in every performance, always looking up to the 'cheap seats' as a reminder of her unwavering belief in him. The song blends heartfelt storytelling with a soaring, radio-friendly hook, incorporating twangy country verses and an anthemic, pop-infused chorus, reminiscent of Luke Combs' emotional depth and Carrie Underwood's polished vocal delivery. The tender ambiguity of grief and the unwavering strength of familial love are central themes.

## Lyrics

Verse 1
Lights dimmed low on that Nashville stage,
Heart poundin' wild, chasin' dreams I'd chased.
Grand Ole Opry, my first big night,
Grandma smilin' proud under them bright lights.
She waved from the crowd, eyes full of grace,
Whispered words that time can't erase.

Pre-Chorus
We laughed 'bout the balcony, high up above,
Said, "These old eyes ain't what they used to love."
But fate had a plan, written in the stars we love,
Now her love's the only light I'm thinkin' of.

Chorus (Hook)
She said she'd see me from the cheap seats,
Heaven or the balcony, it's all the same to me.
That night the call came, took her away too soon,
But every spotlight glow, I feel her in the room.
Lookin' up, lookin' up, where the angels sing along,
Cheap seats forever, keepin' my heart strong.
Yeah, I ain't played a show without lookin' up.

Verse 2
Curtain fell, echoes of applause still ringin',
Phone lit up, world came crashin' in.
Tears on the tour bus, miles from home,
Her voice in my head, sayin' I'm not alone.
That promise she made, in her final breath,
Turns every stage into a bridge over death.

Pre-Chorus
Was it wings or wood rails? I'll never know,
But her love's the spotlight that steals the show.
Shinin' bright, a heaven-sent glow,
Guiding me now, everywhere I go.

Chorus (Hook)
She said she'd see me from the cheap seats,
Heaven or the balcony, it's all the same to me.
That night the call came, took her away too soon,
But every spotlight glow, I feel her in the room.
Lookin' up, lookin' up, where the angels sing along,
Cheap seats forever, keepin' my heart strong.
Yeah, I ain't played a show without lookin' up.

Bridge
Years roll by like old country roads,
Crowds come and go, but her memory holds.
In the roar of the fans, I hear her cheer,
From the highest row, crystal clear.
No goodbye's final when faith's your guide,
She's watchin' proud, right by my side.

Final Chorus (Epic Build â€“ Soaring Vocals and Instrumentation)
She said she'd see me from the cheap seats,
Heaven or the balcony, it's all the same to me.
That night the call came, took her away too soon,
But every spotlight glow, I feel her in the room.
Lookin' up, lookin' up, where the angels sing along,
Cheap seats forever, keepin' my heart strong.
Yeah, I ain't played a show... without lookin' up.

Outro (Fade with Acoustic Guitar and Harmonies)
Lookin' up... lookin' up...
From the cheap seats, Grandma, I feel your love.

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar forms the foundation, layered with electric guitar providing subtle twang and power chords during the chorus. Pedal steel guitar adds a classic country feel. Drums are steady but build in intensity throughout the song, particularly in the final chorus. Piano and strings add depth and emotion.

Tempo: Moderate tempo, allowing the lyrics to breathe and the emotion to resonate.

Key: G Major

Dynamics: Start with a gentle, intimate feel in the verses, gradually building to a powerful and anthemic chorus. The bridge provides a moment of reflection before the final, soaring chorus. The outro should fade out softly with acoustic guitar and layered harmonies.

Vocal Delivery: The verses should be sung with heartfelt sincerity and vulnerability. The chorus should be delivered with strength and conviction, reflecting the enduring power of love and memory. The bridge can be more reflective and introspective.

Production: Aim for a polished, radio-friendly sound with a focus on clear vocals, rich instrumentation, and a powerful mix. The use of reverb and delay can enhance the emotional impact of the song.

Additional Notes: Consider adding a subtle echo effect to the vocal line "Lookin' up... lookin' up..." in the outro to emphasize the feeling of reaching out to a loved one in heaven.
