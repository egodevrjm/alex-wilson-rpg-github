## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The coffee’s cold
But I don't complain
Your voice is soft
But it don’t feel the same
I trace the cracks in the kitchen floor
Hoping you don’t see what I can’t ignore

[Prechorus]
Your eyes still shine
But they don’t reach me
Your laugh still rings
But it don’t teach me

[Chorus]
The flame is fading
But I can’t say it
The words are heavy
So I just delay it
I hold your hand
But I’m losing the grip
Love's a sinking ship
Love's a sinking ship

[Verse 2]
The sunset’s gold
But it don’t feel warm
The sky’s on fire
But we’ve lost the storm
I bite my tongue
Taste the bitter truth
You deserve more than a love untrue

[Prechorus]
Your heart still beats
But I don’t hear it
Your touch still lingers
But I don’t feel it

[Chorus]
The flame is fading
But I can’t say it
The words are heavy
So I just delay it
I hold your hand
But I’m losing the grip
Love's a sinking ship
Love's a sinking ship

[Bridge]
We built a world
On promises we made
Now silence screams
Where laughter used to play
I know it's time
To face what we've become
But tearing us apart,
Feels like the damage is already done.

[Chorus]
The flame is fading
But I can’t say it
The words are heavy
So I just delay it
I hold your hand
But I’m losing the grip
Love's a sinking ship
Love's a sinking ship

[Outro]
Sinking ship...
Fading flame...
We're both to blame...

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked), gentle strings (cello and violin), subtle piano chords, light percussion (brushes on snare). Vocals: Emotional male lead, with harmonies in the chorus. The song should build slightly in intensity towards the bridge and final chorus. The outro fades out with repeating instrumental melody lines. Key of G major. Use a capo on the 2nd fret, played in F major (easier chords). The song should evoke a feeling of sadness and resignation, rather than anger or resentment. Consider adding a pedal steel guitar for a classic country sound. The acoustic guitar rhythm during verses is fairly simple, focusing on arpeggios. Tempo: Slow and deliberate, allowing the emotion of the lyrics to resonate.
