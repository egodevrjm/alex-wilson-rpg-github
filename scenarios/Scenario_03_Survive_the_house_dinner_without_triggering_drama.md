4. Survive the house dinner without triggering drama.

**Hidden Agendas:** Lola needs a guitarist for her cover songs. Audra is secretly scouting for her management company. The last musician they had went viral and then ditched them, leaving everyone wary.

**Scene opens:** Rizz points three phones at Alex. "Okay, so, first things first. We need to know you can hang. The vibe check dinner is at 7\. If Maddie doesn't try to poison you over her kale, you're probably in. First, pitch me your thirty-second intro. Make it good. You're live." A red light blinks on the phone closest to his face. \[What is Alex's pitch?\]

## 30\. Scenario: First Cut at Blackbird Studio (Age 18\)

**Setup:** Monday, April 3, 2023, 11:00 PM. The legendary Blackbird Studio. Alex's buddy Marcus, an intern engineer, snuck him in for an "after-hours test session." He has two hours to lay down one track before the morning engineer arrives.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Session:**

- Marcus is high.  
- The talk-back button is broken.  
- There's a mysterious hum in channel 3\.  
- Alex has a maximum of three takes before time runs out.

**The Complication:** At 12:45 AM, the door opens. It's Chelsea Park, a top A\&R executive for Warner Nashville, grabbing some forgotten notes. She stops, listening to the playback of Alex's take.

**Critical Choices:**

- Play it cool vs. pitch hard.  
- Let Marcus take credit vs. own the rule-breaking.  
- Accept her card vs. play hard to get.

**Scene opens:** The Neve console glows like a spaceship. Marcus is giggling at the EQ knobs. Alex has just nailed the vocal on his second take. The sound of it hangs in the air, raw and perfect. The control room door clicks open. A woman in a tailored blazer stands there, holding a phone, her expression unreadable. "Who the hell are you?" she asks, her voice quiet but carrying immense weight. "And what are you doing in my studio?" \[What does Alex say?\]

## 31\. Scenario: Songwriters' Night at Douglas Corner Cafe (Age 18\)

**Setup:** Tuesday, April 18, 2023, 7:30 PM. Douglas Corner Cafe's legendary songwriters' round. Alex talked his way onto the list. He's on a worn wooden stage with three other songwriters, rotating one song each.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Other Songwriters:**

- **Jim Garrett (62):** Wrote hits in the 90s, now bitter about streaming.  
- **Sophia Chen (28):** TikTok famous, despised by traditional Nashville.  
- **Marcus King (35):** Technically brilliant, emotionally hollow. A "guitar nerd's guitarist."

**The Audience:** A mix of tourists, industry veterans, and aspiring writers. In the back corner, unnoticed, sits Rick Rubin, the legendary producer, who came to see an old friend and is now watching Alex.

**The Challenge:** Alex has one song to make an impression. It's his turn. The room is quiet, waiting.

**Scene opens:** The flickering stage light catches the dust motes in the air. Jim Garrett just finished a cynical song about Spotify, earning polite applause. The host nods to Alex. "Alright, son. Your turn. Show us what you got." Alex adjusts the microphone. He can feel the weight of every legend who has played on this stage. He looks out into the crowd, sees the mix of boredom, hope, and judgment. In the back, a man with a huge white beard leans forward slightly, listening. \[What song does Alex play?\]

## 32\. Scenario: Coal Dust to Music City (Age 20\)

**Setup:** Wednesday, March 12, 2025, 11:47 PM. Alex, 20, has just arrived in Nashville. He was laid off from the mine, his girlfriend left him, and he decided to take his grandmother's guitars and the $3,200 in severance pay and chase the dream.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**Starting Stats:**

- **Cash:** $437 | **Bank:** $2,800  
- **Guitars:** 1959 Martin D-28
- **Vehicle:** 2001 Ford Ranger (146k miles)  
- **Socials:** None (flip phone only)

**The Crisis:** His truck coughs and dies at a red light on Broadway, the busiest, most iconic street in Music City. Horns blare. A Metro Police officer, Melissa Chen, is walking toward him. A homeless vet, Memphis, catches his eye and points to the two valuable guitar cases visible in the truck bed.

**Scene opens:** The neon of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge bleeds across your rain-streaked windshield. Music pours from every doorway. This is it. But your truck is dead, blocking traffic. "MOVE IT, KENTUCKY\!" someone shouts. Officer Chen is ten feet away, hand on her ticket book. The homeless vet shakes his head, a silent warning about the guitars. Brittany's words sting: "Three thousand dollars? That's what four years of your life is worth?" Now what? \[What do you do?\]

## 33\. Scenario: The Blackberry Creek Legacy (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's 2025\. Alex is 22, three years into working the mine after his MawMaw Judith's death. He feels trapped. A week ago, on the anniversary of her passing, he found a hidden lockbox. Inside: a letter and a journal. The letter revealed his MawMaw was Rosie Walker, the vanished country legend, and that his biological grandfather is George Jones. The journal contains 12 of her complete, unreleased songs.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Her final wish: sell the trailer, take the money, and go to Nashville with his best friend, Tommy Crawford, to tell his own story.

**The Immediate Problem:** The trailer has just been sold for $20,000 cash. A fortune. Alex and Tommy are standing in the gravel driveway. Alex's entire life is packed into his duffel bag and Tommy's truck. The weight of the past and the terrifying, exhilarating future crash down at once.

**Scene opens:** The new owner's car pulls away, leaving a cloud of dust. Tommy slaps Alex on the back. "Twenty grand, man. Twenty. Grand." He holds up the wad of cash. "So. We doing this? We really going to Nashville?" The sun is setting over the ridge, casting long shadows from the coal tipple in the distance. This is the first decision of his new life. \[What does Alex do?\]

## 34\. Scenario: The Rosie Walker Mystery (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's early February 2025\. A Netflix documentary crew is in Pikeville, chasing the first lead in 50 years on the whereabouts of vanished country star Rosie Walker—a journal fragment mentioning the town. They are searching for a ghost.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

Meanwhile, Alex Wilson, 22, works the mine, lives in his late grandmother's trailer, and plays her 1959 Martin D-28 at Murphy's Bar on Thursdays for beer money. He has no idea his grandmother was Rosie, or that the guitar is her famous instrument.

**The Accident (Week 2):** On a Thursday night, the crew decides to film "local color" at Murphy's Bar. Alex walks in. The cinematographer freezes. "That guitar… I’ve seen that wear pattern before." They film his set, mesmerized. Back in LA, the remote research team analyzes the footage frame-by-frame. They confirm the serial number. It's Rosie's Martin.

**The Approach (Week 3):** The crew approaches Alex for a paid interview about "Appalachian music traditions." During the interview, he mentions his grandmother, Judith Wilson, raised him. The remote team finds her marriage certificate from March 1973\. Facial recognition software confirms it: Judith Wilson was Rosie Walker. They now know they have found Rosie's grandson, playing her guitar, and he has no idea.

**Scene opens:** A week later. The director, a woman named Chloe, sits across from Alex in his trailer, cameras rolling. "Alex, thanks again for doing this. We just have a few more questions. You mentioned your grandmother never sang. Did she ever talk about Nashville?" Tommy Crawford, sitting on the arm of the couch, snorts. "MawMaw? Hated the place. Used to change the channel if an old country song came on." Chloe leans forward, her expression carefully neutral. "Which songs, specifically?" \[What does Alex say?\]

---

## 35\. Scenario: The Hollywood Honeytrap (Age 22\)

**Setup:** Six months after a video of him playing at Murphy's went viral, Alex is playing a regular Tuesday night gig at The 5 Spot in East Nashville. The place is packed. After his set, a woman approaches him. It's Isabella Vance, one of the biggest movie stars in the world, in town filming a biopic. She tells him she's a huge fan and that his voice is the only real thing she's heard in years.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Honeymoon Phase:** For two weeks, it's a whirlwind. Private jets to LA, parties in the Hollywood Hills, writing songs by her infinity pool. Isabella is smart, funny, and seems genuinely captivated by him. She wants him to write a song for her movie. It feels like a dream.

**The Catch:** Her ex-boyfriend is a notoriously jealous and violent hip-hop mogul who still considers her "his property." Her management team sees Alex as a PR liability and is actively trying to break them up. Paparazzi follow their every move. A tabloid has already run a story titled "Isabella's Backwoods Boy Toy."

**Scene opens:** Alex is in Isabella's suite at the Four Seasons. His guitar is leaning against a wall of windows overlooking the city. Her phone rings. It's her ex. She puts it on speaker. "You still with that fucking hillbilly, Bella? I'm coming to Nashville. We need to talk." The line goes dead. Isabella looks at Alex, her eyes wide with a fear he's seen before—in his own home, years ago. "He's not joking," she whispers. "You need to leave. Now." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 36\. Scenario: The Pikeville Subpoena (Age 22\)

**Setup:** Alex is starting to get real traction in Nashville. He's landed an opening slot for a major artist's tour and is in final negotiations for a publishing deal. He's sitting in his lawyer's office on Music Row, about to sign the papers that will change his life, when the receptionist buzzes. "Mr. Wilson? There's a process server here for you."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Lawsuit:** He's being sued for $2 million for assault and battery. The plaintiff is Chase Matthews, the man whose wedding Alex crashed three years ago to save Amy. Chase claims Alex caused "permanent emotional distress and physical injury" (a broken nose). The lawsuit has been filed by a notoriously aggressive Nashville lawyer known for targeting rising stars.

**The Complication:** The story immediately leaks to the press. The tour's promoter is getting cold feet. The publishing deal is on hold pending the outcome. The lawsuit demands depositions from Amy, her sister Emma, and everyone who was at the wedding—dragging his entire past into his brand-new future. Chase's lawyer offers to settle for $250,000 and a public apology.

**Scene opens:** Alex stands on the pristine marble floor of his lawyer's office, holding the subpoena. The publishing contract sits on the mahogany desk, unsigned. His lawyer, a woman named Carol, sighs. "Well. Welcome to Nashville. The moment you have something to lose, they come for it. Your tour promoter is on line one. The label is on line two. What do you want me to tell them?" \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 37\. Scenario: The Devil's Gig (Age 21\)

**Setup:** Alex is 21 and broke. He's living in a tiny apartment in Donelson, driving for Uber Eats to make rent, and playing any open mic that will have him. An offer comes through a booking agent: a private gig for $50,000, cash. All he has to do is play a one-hour acoustic set.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Client:** The gig is at the lavish estate of Marcus Thorne, a controversial pharmaceutical billionaire whose company is at the center of a massive opioid lawsuit. The party is a fundraiser for a politician known for union-busting and anti-environmental policies—everything that destroyed Alex's hometown.

**The Moral Choice:**

- **Take the gig:** The $50,000 would solve all his problems. It could fund his first EP, buy a reliable van, and let him focus on music full-time for a year.  
- **Refuse the gig:** He'd be turning down life-changing money to stand by his principles. He'd stay broke, but his conscience would be clear.

**The Twist:** A journalist from an independent news outlet has gotten a tip about the party and contacts Alex. "I hear you're playing Thorne's party," she says. "If you wear a wire and record what's said there, we can expose these people. We can't pay you, but you'd be doing the right thing."

**Scene opens:** It's the night of the gig. Alex is sitting in Dolly outside the gates of Thorne's estate. The $25,000 cash advance is in a duffel bag on the passenger seat. His guitar is in the back. His phone buzzes. It's the journalist. "Last chance, Alex. Are you in? Or are you just another musician for hire?" The security guard at the gate taps on his window. "You Wilson? You're on in 30." \[What does Alex do?\]

Of course. Here are 13 new scenarios, bringing the total to 50\. They are formatted to be consistent with the previous collection and integrated with the established lore.

## 38\. Scenario: The Soundalike (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's been a year since Alex arrived in Nashville. He's building a solid reputation for his raw, honest songwriting and his unique vocal style. A new artist, Landon Kade, just dropped his debut single, and it's rocketing up the charts. The problem: the melody is almost identical to a song Alex has been playing at open mics for months, and Kade's vocal delivery mimics Alex's signature gravelly ache.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Complication:** Landon Kade is signed to the biggest label in town and is being pushed as Nashville's next big thing. He's on every radio station, his face on billboards. People are starting to whisper that Alex is the one who's copying *him*. Tommy is furious, urging Alex to fight back.

**The Dilemma:**

- **Go Public:** Accuse Landon Kade of theft. This means taking on a massive corporate machine that could easily bury him in legal fees and blackball him from the industry.  
- **Stay Silent:** Let it go and focus on his own music, knowing that a song he wrote is making someone else a star. This feels like letting his father win—letting someone else take what's his.  
- **The Pikeville Solution:** Confront Landon Kade directly, probably at a bar or backstage, far from any lawyers.

**Scene opens:** The Bluebird Cafe. Alex just finished his set, which included the original version of his song. As he steps off stage, a tourist pats him on the back. "Hey man, you're pretty good\! You do a great cover of that Landon Kade song." In the back of the room, Landon Kade himself is holding court with a group of industry types, laughing. He catches Alex's eye and raises his glass in a mock toast. Tommy puts a hand on Alex's shoulder. "Don't," he says, but his voice is tight with anger. "Don't do it here." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 39\. Scenario: The Mentor's Ghost (Age 23\)

**Setup:** Alex has caught the attention of Harlan "Hank" Crawford, a legendary, reclusive songwriter in his late 70s who wrote hits for Waylon and Cash before disappearing from public life. For three months, Alex has been making weekly pilgrimages to Hank's dilapidated house deep in the Tennessee hills, playing him new songs and listening to his stories. It's the closest thing to a grandfather he's ever had.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Last Request:** Hank is dying of lung cancer. One afternoon, he pushes a dusty reel-to-reel tape recorder towards Alex. "There's one song on there," he rasps. "The last one I ever wrote. 'bout the woman I couldn't save. Never could get the damn thing right." He makes Alex promise to listen to it only after he's gone, and to "finish it right." Hank dies two days later.

**The Secret on the Tape:** Alex plays the tape. It's a haunting, broken, brilliant song about regret. But after the song ends, there's a voice-memo recording. It's Hank, talking to a friend years ago. He's drunk, and he's confessing: he was there the night Rosie Walker played her last show. He helped her get on the bus out of town because she was running from a powerful, abusive label executive—the same executive who now runs the label that is currently scouting Alex.

**Scene opens:** Alex sits in his apartment, the silence after the tape's confession deafening. The song Hank left him is a masterpiece, but it's tied to a secret that could protect him or destroy his chances in Nashville. His phone rings. It's the label executive, the one from the tape. "Alex," the voice says smoothly, "I heard about Harlan. A great talent. Listen, I want to bring you in tomorrow. I think it's time we made you a star." \[What does Alex do?\]

## 40\. Scenario: The High School Reunion (Age 24\)

**Setup:** Alex is 24 and has a certified Gold record. He's a known name, a rising star. He gets an invitation to his five-year high school reunion in Pikeville. Tommy convinces him it'll be a legendary weekend. Amy will be there, now divorced from Chase Matthews. The whole town will be there.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Homecoming:** The moment he and Tommy arrive in Pikeville, it's clear things are different. He's not just "the Wilson boy" anymore; he's a celebrity. Old teachers want autographs. People who ignored him in school now claim to be his best friends. The Sheriff wants a selfie. It's suffocating.

**The Confrontation:** The reunion is held at the Pikeville Country Club—the same place he crashed Amy's wedding. Chase Matthews is there, drunk and belligerent, telling anyone who will listen that Alex stole his life. He's looking for a fight. Meanwhile, Amy is trying to talk to Alex, to apologize, to maybe rekindle something.

**The Choice:** This isn't just a party; it's a referendum on his past. He can be the gracious celebrity, the angry kid who never forgot a slight, or the man who is finally free of this town. Every interaction is being filmed on a dozen phones.

**Scene opens:** The country club ballroom is a sea of familiar, changed faces. The DJ, as a joke, plays the radio single of Alex's hit song. The crowd cheers. Amy is walking toward him, a hopeful, nervous smile on her face. From across the room, Chase Matthews shouts, "Hey superstar\! Still writing songs about other men's wives?" The room goes quiet. A hundred phone cameras are suddenly pointed at him. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 41\. Scenario: The Nashville Blackout (Age 22\)

**Setup:** A massive summer storm has knocked out power to all of East Nashville. It's 9 PM. Alex was supposed to play a showcase at The Basement, but the gig is cancelled. The streets are dark, the bars are closed. People are wandering outside, restless.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Idea:** Tommy, ever the agent of chaos, has an idea. He backs Dolly the F-150 onto the sidewalk in the middle of Five Points, the neighborhood's central hub. He points two high-powered flashlights from the truck bed at Alex. "No power, no problem," he says. "Give 'em a show."

**The Gathering:** At first, it's just a few dozen people. But as the sound of Alex's unamplified voice and acoustic guitar cuts through the silent, dark night, a crowd gathers. People emerge from their powerless homes, drawn by the music. Soon, hundreds of people are standing in the street, phone flashlights held up like lighters, listening in rapt silence.

**The Viral Moment 2.0:** A journalist for the *Nashville Scene* lives in an apartment overlooking the intersection. She starts a livestream. \#NashvilleBlackoutSessons starts trending. This performance is stripped bare—no mics, no lights, no stage. Just his voice, his guitar, and the sound of the rain.

**Scene opens:** Alex is sitting on the tailgate of his truck. A crowd of 200 strangers stands before him in the dark, their faces illuminated by their phones. The only other light comes from the flashlights Tommy has taped to the truck's roll bar. It's an intimate, intense, completely unexpected concert. "I, uh, only know about four more songs," Alex says with a laugh, his voice carrying in the stillness. A woman in the front row shouts, "Then play 'em slow\!" The crowd cheers. \[What song does he play next?\]

---

## 42\. Scenario: The Betrayal (Age 23\)

**Setup:** Alex's career is taking off, but he's fiercely protective of his privacy and his past. He's turned down every interview request from tabloids and gossip sites. One morning, he wakes up to a front-page article on a major music blog titled: "The Secret Pain of Alex Wilson: The Father, The Abuse, The Woman He Saved."

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Article:** The piece contains details Alex has only ever told one person: his best friend, Tommy. It details the beatings from his father, the story of crashing Amy's wedding, and quotes lyrics from a song he's never performed, only written in a notebook he keeps in his apartment. The source is quoted as "a close childhood friend."

**The Confrontation:** Alex finds Tommy in their apartment, packing a bag. Tommy can't meet his eye. "They offered me fifty grand, Alex," he says, his voice breaking. "My mom's medical bills... I was gonna tell you. I swear." He had been secretly recording their conversations for weeks.

**The Fallout:** The story is everywhere. The narrative Alex has carefully controlled is shattered. His privacy is gone. And his trust in the one person he thought he had is destroyed.

**Scene opens:** Tommy stands in the doorway, duffel bag in hand. "I'm sorry," he whispers. "I never thought... I just... I can pay it back." Alex's phone is buzzing nonstop with calls from his publicist, his manager, his lawyer. The rawest parts of his life are now public knowledge, sold for cash by his brother. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 43\. Scenario: The Grand Ole Opry Debut (Age 24\)

**Setup:** Alex has been invited to make his debut at the Grand Ole Opry. It is the single biggest moment of his career, the culmination of everything he's worked for. He has an eight-minute slot and is scheduled to play two songs.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Ghost in the Circle:** The Opry is where his grandmother, Rosie Walker, gave her final, legendary performance before she vanished. The old-timers on staff remember her. The archivist shows him a photo of Rosie standing in the very same spot backstage where he's tuning his guitar. "She was a firecracker, that one," the old man says. "Broke every heart and every rule in this building."

**The Dilemma:** Alex planned to play his two biggest hits. But standing in that sacred circle, he's overwhelmed by the weight of his grandmother's legacy. He has one of her unreleased songs memorized—a beautiful, heartbreaking ballad called "Coal Dust Memories." Playing it would be a secret tribute, a nod to the ghost in the room that only he understands. But it's a slow, sad song, not the crowd-pleaser his team expects for his debut.

**Scene opens:** The stage manager gives him the one-minute signal. The legendary curtain is about to rise. The announcer is reading his introduction. The crowd is roaring. His manager gives him a thumbs-up from the wings. His setlist is on the floor by the microphone: "Kentucky Rain" and "Whiskey and Regret." But the melody of "Coal Dust Memories" is in his head. He can almost feel his grandmother's presence. The announcer finishes: "...please welcome, for his Grand Ole Opry debut, Alex Wilson\!" \[What song does he play first?\]

---

## 44\. Scenario: The Stalker (Age 23\)

**Setup:** A fan, who goes by the online handle "AlexsAngel," has become increasingly obsessive. At first, it was just intense social media comments. Then came detailed letters sent to his management. Now, things have escalated. She shows up at his gigs, staring from the front row without blinking. She somehow got his unlisted address and has been leaving "gifts" on his doorstep: a framed photo of herself, a single dead rose, a lock of her hair tied with a red ribbon.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Escalation:** His team files a restraining order, but she violates it immediately. One night, Alex comes home to find his apartment door unlocked. Nothing is stolen, but a new photo is on his pillow: it's of him, sleeping, clearly taken from inside his bedroom.

**The Choice:** The police say they can't do much until she physically harms him. His manager wants to hire a full-time security detail, which would mean giving up what little freedom he has left. Tommy wants to "go have a chat" with her, a Pikeville solution that will almost certainly end in jail time.

**Scene opens:** It's 2 AM. Alex is sitting in his dark living room, guitar across his lap, unable to sleep. A notification pops up on his phone. It's a live-stream alert from "AlexsAngel." He clicks it. The video is shaky, filmed from a parked car. It's pointed directly at his living room window. In the video's chat, she types: "He's awake. He's thinking about me. Soon he'll understand we're meant to be." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 45\. Scenario: The Vocal Injury (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex is in the middle of his first headlining national tour. It's a grueling schedule of 50 shows in 60 days. His voice, his most powerful instrument, is starting to give out. He's been pushing through the raspiness and pain, but during a soundcheck in Chicago, it happens: he goes for a high note and his voice cracks, then disappears into a pained whisper.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Diagnosis:** A top specialist in the city gives him the verdict: a hemorrhaged vocal cord. The prescription is devastating: six weeks of absolute vocal rest—no talking, no singing, nothing—followed by months of therapy. If he pushes it, the damage could be permanent.

**The Stakes:** Cancelling the tour would be a financial catastrophe for him and his entire crew. It would kill his career momentum and label him as "unreliable." His manager suggests using pre-recorded vocal tracks to lip-sync the rest of the tour, something Alex finds artistically abhorrent.

**Scene opens:** Alex is backstage in his dressing room, 30 minutes before showtime. 15,000 people are chanting his name. The doctor's report is on the table next to a bottle of whiskey. His tour manager walks in, holding an earpiece and a microphone. "I've loaded the tracks from the Nashville show," he says softly. "Nobody has to know. Just go out there and give them a show." The first notes of his opening song's intro begin to play over the arena's PA system. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 46\. Scenario: The Lost Relative (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex's identity as Rosie Walker's grandson is now public knowledge, confirmed by a major *Rolling Stone* feature. He's in the process of claiming her estate, including the rights to her unreleased songs. One week before the final legal hearing, a man named Jesse Walker comes forward.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Claim:** Jesse, a 50-year-old musician from Texas, claims to be Rosie Walker's secret son, from a relationship she had *before* she came to Nashville. He has letters and a faded photograph that seem to support his story. He files a legal challenge, claiming he is the rightful heir to the entire estate.

**The Media Circus:** The story explodes. "ROSIE'S SECRET SON?" is the headline on every entertainment site. Jesse is sympathetic, a struggling artist who just wants to know his mother's legacy. He publicly asks Alex for a DNA test to "unite their family."

**The Doubt:** Alex's lawyers are skeptical. They believe Jesse is a fraud, but the letters look authentic, and a legal battle could freeze the estate for years. The label sees a PR nightmare. The public is split.

**Scene opens:** Alex is in a conference room with his lawyers. On the table are copies of Jesse's evidence. His lawyer points to a photo of a young Rosie with a baby. "He looks convincing, Alex. A jury will love him. He's requested a meeting, without lawyers. Says he just wants to talk, musician to musician. It's a trap. But if you refuse, you look like you're hiding something." Alex's phone buzzes. It's a text from an unknown number: "Don't believe him. Your grandmother told me everything. Meet me. \- H.C." \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 47\. Scenario: The Boone Ultimatum (Age 22\)

**Setup:** It's been a year since Alex learned his mother's family, the wealthy Boones of California, were alive. After an initial, awkward meeting, he has kept his distance, determined to make it on his own. Now, he's hit a wall. His van has died, he's about to be evicted, and a promising record deal just fell through.

**Continuity check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\] (Scenario 21 is a potential import)

**The Offer:** His maternal grandmother, Patricia Boone, a formidable retired judge, flies to Nashville. She meets him for lunch at a place so fancy it makes him uncomfortable. She lays out an offer: The Boone family will set up a $5 million trust fund for him. It's his, no strings... with one exception.

**The Condition:** He must quit the "unseemly business of public performance." They will pay for him to get a law degree from Stanford. He can write music in his spare time, as a "gentleman's hobby." "Your mother was a scholar, Alexander," Patricia says, her voice kind but firm. "She would have wanted a respectable life for you, away from the kind of world that consumed your father and grandmother."

**The Ultimatum:** She gives him 24 hours to decide. Accept, and his financial struggles are over forever. Refuse, and the Boone family will cut off all contact, permanently.

**Scene opens:** Alex is back in his crappy apartment. The eviction notice is on the counter. His wallet is empty. A pristine, embossed business card from "Boone Family Investments" sits next to the eviction notice. On the back, his grandmother has written: "Make the right choice. For your mother." His guitar is in the corner, the strings dulled from a hundred open mics that led nowhere. \[What does Alex do?\]

---

## 48\. Scenario: The Unfinished Song (Age 24\)

**Setup:** While going through the notebooks from Rosie Walker's estate, Alex finds a hidden page. On it is a single, perfect verse and a half-finished chorus for a song titled "Shenandoah Sunrise." It's a song about finally finding peace after a lifetime of running. It's clearly the last song she ever tried to write, but it's incomplete.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Creative Dilemma:** The fragment is a work of genius. Alex feels an overwhelming urge to finish it, to collaborate with his grandmother across time. But he's terrified. Is it his place to put words in her mouth? What if he can't do it justice? Completing it feels both like an act of love and an act of sacrilege.

**The Pressure:** His producer, who knows about the fragment, is pushing him hard to finish it for his next album, seeing it as a guaranteed Grammy-winner and a massive publicity hook. "The song Rosie Walker's grandson finished\!"

**Scene opens:** It's 3 AM in the empty RCA Studio A. Alex has been sitting with his guitar for hours, staring at a photocopy of Rosie's handwritten lyrics. The melody is in his head, but the words for the second verse won't come. He feels like a fraud. He's about to pack it in when his phone lights up with a memory notification. It's a photo from five years ago: him and his MawMaw on her porch, the sun rising over the Kentucky hills. A line comes to him. The first line of the second verse. \[Does he write it down?\]

## 49\. Scenario: The Governor's Ball (Age 25\)

**Setup:** Alex has become a significant cultural figure in Tennessee and beyond. He is invited to perform at the Governor of Tennessee's Inaugural Ball—a prestigious, high-profile event. The governor is a moderate, but his party is pushing a controversial "Artistic Decency" bill that would censor song lyrics and defund arts education.

**Continuity Check**: Fresh Alex unless importing: \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\]

**The Factions:**

- **The Governor's Office:** Wants a clean, patriotic performance. They've "suggested" he play a specific set of his most uncontroversial hits.  
- **The Opposition Party:** Is pressuring him to use the stage as a platform to denounce the bill and the governor.  
- **An Activist Group:** Has threatened to protest outside and inside the event, potentially disrupting his performance if he doesn't make a strong statement.  
- **His Record Label:** Is terrified of him alienating half the state and has threatened to pull promotional support for his album if he gets "political."

**The Choice:** This isn't just a gig; it's a political minefield. He can play it safe, make a bold statement, or try to find a third way to speak his mind through his music. Every news camera in the state will be on him.

**Scene opens:** Alex is backstage in a tuxedo that feels like a costume. The governor has just come by to shake his hand. "We're all so proud of you, son. A real Tennessee success story," he'd said. "Looking forward to a great, unifying performance." Alex can hear the polite applause from the ballroom. The stage manager hands him a guitar. "You're on in two minutes, Mr. Wilson." In his pocket is a folded piece of paper with the lyrics to one of Rosie Walker's old, unreleased protest songs. \[What does he do?\]
