## Lyrics

Verse 1:
Clocked out at five, got dirt on my hands
Washed off the week with some soap and some plans
Got my paycheck burning a hole in my jeans
Time to forget what Monday might mean

Chorus:
All I need is a beer on a Friday night
(Beer on a Friday night!)
Cold can in my hand and everything's alright
(Everything's alright!)
Work can wait till Monday, tonight I'm feeling free
All I need is a beer on a Friday night with me
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Verse 2:
Jukebox is playing that song that we love
Pool table's calling, push comes to shove
Bartender's pouring them icy and tall
Friday night fever is calling us all

Chorus:
All I need is a beer on a Friday night
(Beer on a Friday night!)
Cold can in my hand and everything's alright
(Everything's alright!)
Work can wait till Monday, tonight I'm feeling free
All I need is a beer on a Friday night with me
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Bridge:
Sunday's got church, Monday's got work
Tuesday through Thursday, they're all gonna hurt
But Friday night's magic ain't hard to find
Just leave the grind behind, leave the grind behind

Chorus:
All I need is a beer on a Friday night
(Beer on a Friday night!)
Cold can in my hand and everything's alright
(Everything's alright!)
Work can wait till Monday, tonight I'm feeling free
All I need is a beer on a Friday night
Just a beer on a Friday night
All I need is a beer on a Friday night with me
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Outro:
A beer on a Friday night, yeah!
(Beer on a Friday night!)
A beer on a Friday night, alright!
(Everything's alright!)

## Performance Notes

Instrumentation: Standard honky-tonk setup - acoustic guitar, electric guitar (telecaster with a bit of twang), bass guitar, drums, pedal steel guitar (for fills and solos), and possibly a honky-tonk piano. Consider a harmonica for the bridge or a solo after the second chorus.

Tempo: Upbeat and energetic, but not frantic. Keep a steady, driving rhythm.

Vocals: Alex's vocals should be gritty and genuine, conveying the weariness of the week and the joy of release. The backing vocals during the call-and-response parts should be raw and enthusiastic, giving it a gang vocal feel.

Key: E Major would be suitable for a bright and singable feel.

Arrangement: Consider a slight build-up in intensity towards the final chorus. A guitar solo or pedal steel break between the bridge and the final chorus would add excitement. The outro could fade out with the band repeating "A beer on a Friday night!"

Performance Tips: Encourage audience participation during the call-and-response sections. Alex can point the microphone to the crowd to get them involved. Emphasize the "Hey! Hey! Hey!" at the end of each chorus for maximum impact.
